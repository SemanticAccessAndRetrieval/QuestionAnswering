If you stay beyond 12pm you get charged a further ¥400 per hour. We found out the hard way with a ¥2000 charge. Also we didn't realise there would be a further ¥1200 charge for hire of the cot. This wasn't charged on arrival when you pay for the room, so was also a surprise when we checked out. - The location of the property was great. It is based in Meriken park, right next to the earthquake memorial and easy access off the expressway. The hotel has its own parking which is really helpful (although is ¥1600 for 24 hours). The staff are friendly as you would expect and the reception area of the hotel is stunning. We were there in December and they had a beautiful Christmas tree and accessories. As you go up the lift to your room there are great views of the reception area. We stayed with a toddler and requested a cot. As they weren't sure if the cot would be big enough (we have a two year old) they also kindly fitted a bed guard to one side of the double bed so we could use that if the cot was too small.;;11/12/2016;;0

Your smartphone connected to the wifi is much better. There might be a heater(?) sitting on the ground, didn't know how to work it as instructions were all in native language which makes it a little defunct for people with poor Japanese language skills, such as myself. - Great location to explore from, room was spacious compared to others. Clean and tidy. Decor is modern. Bed nice and firm and bedding very nice. The complimentary western style buffet breakfast is a bonus, if not to your liking find something on the street, plenty of eats close by. Wife loved that they served "normal" black tea with milk and sugar. Take home slippers;;22/04/2016;;0

Luckily the other guests are very helpfull with explaining things. - A once in a lifetime experience. Sleeping in a capsule seems odd. Maybe it is odd. But it's more than just the rather comfortable capsules themselves. You also have a public bathing room with sauna and a relaxation area. It's very japanese and not for people who don't want to try something different (but then japan wasn't a good destination either). I thought it was a great experience.;;26/05/2014;;0
136;;q2;;Is this hotel quiet?;;urn:uuid:f15fecee-3345-4777-ba5e-b5acf9fd06e2;;Our room was very tired with quite a few stains on the carpet. We were also surprised at the car parking price. Their website states ¥1600 per 24 hours. However we found that this was actually the price from when you check in until 12pm the next day. If you stay beyond 12pm you get charged a further ¥400 per hour. We found out the hard way with a ¥2000 charge. Also we didn't realise there would be a further ¥1200 charge for hire of the cot. This wasn't charged on arrival when you pay for the room, so was also a surprise when we checked out. - The location of the property was great. It is based in Meriken park, right next to the earthquake memorial and easy access off the expressway. The hotel has its own parking which is really helpful (although is ¥1600 for 24 hours). The staff are friendly as you would expect and the reception area of the hotel is stunning. We were there in December and they had a beautiful Christmas tree and accessories. As you go up the lift to your room there are great views of the reception area. We stayed with a toddler and requested a cot. As they weren't sure if the cot would be big enough (we have a two year old) they also kindly fitted a bed guard to one side of the double bed so we could use that if the cot was too small.;;11/12/2016;;0
