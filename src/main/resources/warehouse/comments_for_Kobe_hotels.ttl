Not what I'd expect for a Crowne Plaza, club floor experience...more like a Holiday Inn. 4) When we were checking in, there was no offer to help us with our luggage. 5) We were not greeted in the lobby with a smile, but with a firm statement that check in was not until 3 (this was 2:15pm and we were very weary travelers)...not a good way to start our over $270/night club floor experience. - Erika on the club floor was nice. Hotel is convenient to the Shin-Kobe station and cable car, and has a beautiful lobby, amazing view, and adequate fitness center." .

Rooms were a bit small for the price (but we visited during Golden Week so prices were a lot higher than normal). It was a bit of a walk from Shin-Kobe and even the metro station. Not recommended with luggage. The Sannomiya JR station was much more convenient but we did not arrive or leave from that station. - The yukata were nice. Having laundry facilities and an available computer in the lobby (in addition to the included in-room wifi) was also an added benefit. Mattress, bedding, toiletries, in-room tea were better than at some other similar hotels. We appreciated the luggage rack to help make the most of the smallish room space. Everything was simple but impeccably clean. Staff were very patient with us, they didn't speak much English and we spoke almost no Japanese. We were near everything--restaurants, stores, nightlife--but not too close so that nights were very quiet, even with the windows open. Silly thing to comment on, but we also liked the bedside light switches and clock!" .

And especially grateful to the driver who found my rental wifi router and left it with the Tourist Information Centre while I was uncontactable at Mount Rokko. The meals were extremely generous. We had dinner in a posh restaurant located in a 10-stores hotel 2mins walk away from the Ryokan. Breakfast is another generous meal served in the Ryokan itself.

        hip:hasText  "The included breakfast was adequate, but not compelling. We invariably bypassed it and went for our daily Vie de France fix at Kobe station. Because the lobby for the hotel is on the second floor, the elevator normally always stops on floor 2 to allow the desk staff to inspect the occupants. Some might find that off-putting and be concerned about just how much security that glance across the room provides. The real disadvantage to the hotel is that it is in Kobe. If your intended destination is Kobe, then it is perfectly located and I suspect most guests will be delighted by the facilities in the area. If you intend to use it as a base for visiting other locations in Kansai, such as Osaka or Kyoto, take into account that you will lose between 2 to 3 hours each day in transit time. While Kobe station is about a 3 minute walk south from the hotel entrance, you can expect to spend nearly an hour just to get to Osaka station...and you'll probably be standing all the way, too, due to the high passenger load. JR Pass holders can get to Shin-Kobe station by walking 3 blocks north and taking the subway (which will cost around 210 yen) a few stops to the east. The walk up the hill may take you 10 minutes, but the subway runs less frequently than one might hope, so it could be up to 30 minutes before you board the subway. Best case scenario is making Shin-Kobe in 25 minutes if the stars are perfectly aligned, but it could easily take 45 minutes or more depending on your personal walking speed. While Shinkansen appear to arrive at frequent intervals at Shin-Kobe, a surprising number of them are not suitable for JR Pass holders and you might have to wait 30 minutes for a train suitable for you. [Editorially, Kobe is far enough West that you are in JR West territory and the level of service is shockingly inferior to JR Central]. Osaka might be 15 minutes away by Shinkansen and Kyoto another 15 on top of that, but the latencies involved quickly add up. - The staff was very friendly and proficient with English. Housekeeping kept room spotless. The rooms are well-provisioned, including facial cleanser, cleaning oil, toner and lotion in the bathroom and a humidifier for the room. The hotel's laundry facilities are convenient (300 yen for a laundry load with detergent automatically dispensed, 100 yen for 30 minutes of \"dryer\" time). The hotel has an extremely desirable location within Kobe. It is merely a block away from Kobe station, and there are numerous shopping opportunities and restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Mosaic has both an Ultraman M-78 store as well as a Rilakuma shop. The Old Spaghetti Factory was so tasty we had to go more than once. The harbor area is very pretty, especially at night. For the most part, this is a very calm, family-friendly area, though one can hear the sirens of ambulances passing by on occasion. While Kobe harbor is very busy and the horns of maneuvering ships are often heard at the water's edge, we never heard them from the hotel." .

Before the arrival we were called by the hotel to be sure that we were arriving, it was only 7 p.m. Arriving at the hotel (close to a station) we were expecting a \"luxurious\" hotel. Although the entrance seemed very nice, inside looks oldish with old furnitures. Then at the reception, the staff was quite fast to finish their business a smiling face would have been appreciated. Anyway, in the room, we had the surprise to find a half filled bottle of tea in the fridge (from a previous customer) with nothing else inside (they could at least clean the fridge). The view is in front of another building, not very comfy for some intimacy. Breakfast now... Well after all this, we did not expect something very particular, and indeed, the breakfast was okay... Although we had to wait for coffee and didn't have a lot to eat (not salty). They charged a lot for not much. I was happy to leave. - The bed was comfortable... That's basically all" .

If you’re gonna call yourself a resort then up your game and make it worth the money your guests are dropping. Nothing within walking distance - that said the resort van is able to drive you anywhere you’d like to go. Rooms smelled musty like an old barn, they were however quite clean despite the aged appearance. Now this lady one us Booking.com’s fault I think. I booked for a single person - but when I arrived, I was told I booked for two people, meaning I paid double. And the resort itself apologized (they did a lot of that) that regretfully they could not refund me anything. - The private onsen is quite nice. Though they only let you book once during your stay no matter how dead. Also not worth the money spent. The younger staff were quite friendly and accommodating. Though as an international tourist destination you’d figure ther d be more than one person that knows a few languages. Especially English." .

One enters a small empty lobby and finds a sign directing one to the reception on the 5th floor where the hotel actually starts. The rooms are arrayed around the courtyard so on cold and windy days it is cold and windy on the way from the elevator to the room - this could be an advantag in the summer though: better air circulation. My room was on the top 10th floor. - Breakfast buffet and staff. Everything about the room was fine, except wall to wall carpets that show their very advanced age." .

The room was huge and very cosy. The view was tranquil, and when opening the window the sound of a nearby river flowing only helped sooth the senses (as well as make you need the en-suite restroom)" .

There was a hole in a wall, as if someone had punched it and nothing had been done to cover it up and the bed sheets were very worn out. The general feeling of the room and building was that of past grandeur. Another interesting detail is that the hotel does not have signs in English with its name, so you'll have to recognize the ideograms to know you are there. It is close to the train station (to get here from the shinkansen station in Kobe you'll have to take the subway, then a train, then change to another train), but at the end of a very steep walk uphill. They'll take you to the train station by car when you check out, but only until 11 am (so if you want to hang out in Arima Onsen for a few hours, you'll the need to walk your luggage to the station). The greatest con of this place, though, is the price: way too much for what you get! - We booked one night here because we wanted to try the very Japanese experience of a Ryokan with an onsen. Unfortunately we had some trouble getting here because of unrelated issues and we only got to the hotel at night time, which prevented us from fully enjoying an evening here. We still got to try the baths because they are open until 1 am at night (and from 5 am to 10 am in the morning), and they were lovely, though rather small (and you have to be comfortable going around naked!). The people here all do their best to try and understand you and be helpful, but sometimes it is even too much and they are a little bit \"too present\" for you. They give you plenty of free green tea and lovely yukatas to wear when you are going around. We didn't try the food, so no comment on that." .

The thing that stands out is my wife commenting that this hotel had bigger and more comfortable beds than our other hotel. Price wise it was more than our other hotel but that may have been due to our short period there." .

I am certain that our room was one of them. The ambient cigarette smell in our guest room was unpleasant and not easy to sleep. I wish they did a better job of remodeling the room. Also, there is no way to adjust the room temperature, but just to turn the heat on or off. Our guest room was too warm as we tried to circulate the air to lessen the ambient smoke smell. There was no air purifier and no way to let the outside air in either. Because there are \"smoking rooms\" (I saw one on the 35th floor) where people can go in to smoke in a closed environment within the building, the elevators and the hallway where the smokers had gone through smelled like cigarette smoke. I wish this hotel would move onto a smoke-free property, not just the guest rooms. - Great access to Shin Kobe bullet train station. There are lots of restaurants in and around the building. There is a direct access to the subway station from which you can head down to Sannomiya in just a few minutes." .

NIGHTMARE experience, when I went to complain I realised that all staff, including front desk, know only pre-learned English phrases and are entirely useless when confronted with anything else. They were then rude and said I did not put \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, which they didn't have - but initial receptionist when I had a conversation with her, said - LIED - that for sake of environment the room will ONLY be cleaned if I put up a \"clean please\" sign (which they did have). Do not be fooled, none of them have any idea what they are saying when they speak English.

Also, the hotel is very expensive, as are the restaurant and bar downstairs ($14 for a small beer!). I think I've complained about this before, but they really should include breakfast with your room. Also, for some reason the air conditioner wasn't turned on, so my room was warm and stuffy. - I've stayed at this hotel several times because it is next to my conference venue. The building and hotel are very modern, with several restaurants within grounds." .

I managed about 3 hours u interrupted sleep. 2nd night, loud snoring too audible from adjoining room (or possible mechanical noise - not elevator). Again 3 or 4 hours uninterrupted sleep.

For the dated swimmingpool, sauna, gym area you are expected to pay around 4000 yen for a day. Only the gym is around 2000. - The location of this hotel and the sights from the rooms over kobe and the harbour are absolutely great. Rooms are larger then normal in Japan / Kobe. Next to that the beds are great, westernstyle large and comfortable. The hotel offers a pricy but decent breakfast. Every morning a fresh newspaper at your door. Wifi is fast and free. Nextdoor to the hotel are nice malls and restaurants and with the free shuttlebus you are in 10 minutes at the trainstation. The best of this hotel is the very friendly, helpful and service oriented staff. These people make it a great place." .

Third, they dont have Gym and Swimmingpool, which i dont understand since they have two big water fountains. - The room was very clean and the best was the jacuzzi with view over the ocean.

Although there are more modern shopping complexes in Haborland, the more famous places like Ishida (for Kobe Beef) are in the heart of Kobe. - The bonus of this hotel is that you can use the hotel shuttle bus from Bus Terminal 9 near Sannomiya Station, Kobe and it will take you straight to the front of the hotel. It saves you from having to walk or pay to travel to the hotel. Just remember to get the free shuttle bus ticket from the front desk when you want to leave the hotel and head back to Sannomiya Station (you only need a ticket on your return. They don't ask for a ticket when you leave the station). Plus there is no limit to how many times you go back and forth. The bus shuttle only takes about 15 mins and stops at only two hotels (one being the Oriental Hotel). Check in is normally 3 pm. Like most hotels, they will let you leave your luggage at the front desk. The room itself was larger room than most hotels in Japan and the toiletries they provided were really nice. The hotel has a great view of both the Harborland and Meriken Park at night. The flashy lights really make the place feel like you are staying in the most expensive place in town. Plus Harborland is only 10 mins walk away from the hotel and the walk is nice since you pass by many of the key Kobe attractions (Kobe's Ferris Wheel, Port of Kobe Tower, etc). You also get your luggage taken to your room as well." .

They wanted to charge 66% of a full day rate (which isn't cheap for 4 hours!) I found the uncompromisig attitude and price extortionate - It really is a great hotel, well located, the rooms are excellent and really well furnished. The breakfast was beyond reproach and the view from the restaurant really great. The Old world ambiance is well done" .

        hip:hasText  "Staff seemed nice but could be a little more professional - they didn't seem confident speaking even basic English and one girl looked kinda nervous. As someone who can speak some Japanese I had difficulty understanding her as she spoke too quickly (perhaps she assumed I was fluent by the two words of Japanese I muttered!). I think with the amount of foreign tourists coming and going through there they should probably default to a a standard English greeting first or ask you which language you are comfortable with. Check in time was 3pm and they seem quite strict with that when I arrived early, though the staff were nice enough to recognize I wanted to offload my baggage and offered to store it while I wandered about nearby. The room could have been cleaner (or at least inspected better) in my opinion, I found a few long hair on the bed and in the bathroom! Not a deal breaker but kinda off putting. The breakfast is overpriced - avoid. Sure you get a \"buffet style\" but that doesn't matter when the food is terrible. 1080 yen is pretty steep for sub par food at the Italian restaurant downstairs. The coffee was left on the pot too long and tasted burnt and bitter (yes I'm a coffee snob but this tasted like poison), flavorless powdered scramble eggs and overdone, hard pizza (pizza is meant to be their thing, how did they get this wrong?). The only thing that saved it was the garlic toast and salad. I could've had a better experience at 7-11! - Very convenient central location near Sannomiya subway west exit. There's a 7-11 on the same block and a nice shrine right around the corner. Plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Room was comfortable and quiet at night with a window blind that keeps the outside light out which helps when trying to sleep.. Nice shower that has good pressure and a decent sized bathtub. Check out time is at 11 (some places have earlier which I find annoying). Free tea in the room and coffee downstairs." .

Since it is in a residential area, it is quiet, but you can still find convenient stores around." .

The attention to detail and the service were both exceptional. It's pricey for sure but most definitely worth it, guarantee to be memorable! The food was beautifully presented, using the freshest and finest ingredients. It was my birthday and they gave extra 'service' during dinner to celebrate it. Everything really was meticulously prepared. Including everything you need in the bathroom, to the robes to wear around town! The hot spring is clean, and relaxing. We only used the private one and never had a problem booking a slot. We most definitely hope to return one day!" .

But in general it was a good experience. - Meriken is a good choice for tourist visiting Kobe coz the location in the port provides an amazing views to the Harbour, Port Land and Kobe Tower. The rooms are comfortable and have terrace but are little bit outdated. The bed was so comfortable and the views are on top if you like the sea. The breakfast is amazing and best experience if there is good weather and can do it at terrace. Little bit expensive but good in average if you can afford it. The staff were so kind and help a lot with a problem to extend the booking. Also they have a shuttle bus to Sannomiya St. wich is very convenient." .

For the price is great but honestly for a good holiday I wouldn't stay there and missing out on my proper sleep. Also the walls are very thin so you can hear what people talk. Not good at all.

There is no bathroom in the room, which means you have to take shower in the public shower next to the indoor onsen pool. Which also means you have to be naked in front of the public. This was the first time for me and my friend. I think it was acceptable (to be naked in front of other ladies), but not everyone can deal with this (include my friend). If you can't accept it, you might need to get some other ryokan that provides private onsen in the room. If you can accept it, please go and have a try, it will be a special experience for you. - The hotel staffs were very good. Though they don't speak English (couldn't really communicate in simple English at all) they tried to explain until we understand. They are friendly and put smile on their face and greet us every time when we saw them in the hotel compound. The onsen were excellent! They exchange the male and female onsen every day so that we can actually enjoy the both onsen. We were there during winter, we really had a great time enjoying the onsen, especially the outdoor one, it's really spectacular!" .

I penned a mail the night before arriving at Arima Onsen requesting for transport from the bus station and was pleasantly surprised to receive a reply with a phone number link. At the bus station, the hotel vehicle arrived within minutes. When we checked out the following morning to go up to Mt Rokko not only were they will to sakekeep our luggage but also provided transport to bring us to the Ropeway Station. The driver also left a number for us to call when we return to the station. Later in the afternoon, when the driver came to pick us up, he had already loaded our luggage in the van and willingly sent us to the next hotel we were checking in to. There are three hot bath areas because it is related to the neighboring hotel. The walk to the one of the open air bath was interesting. The meal that included Kobe Beef shabu shabu was sumptuous." .

The room is quite small as well as the bed. The lifts is also quite small, and it fits probably 6 people or so. The hotel is in also in a shady place because you start to move away from the city lights and the shops/restaurants and it gets darker as you get closer to the hotel. The shops were on the other side of the town. Didn't feel 100% safe. Not recommended for families or solo female travellers or female travellers in a small group. - Being greeted by the staff is always a plus in Japan. Free computers for public to use (had to use Google maps!). There was a buffet in the morning (Japanese) but we missed it and it looked pretty good - the buffets free. The hotel was also quite clean - not the best but quite good. Overall, it was the price that got us as my girlfriend and I were on a budget and it came down to just $30aud/usd per person, per night - and we only stayed one night as it was a Kobe day trip. This is recommended for people for short stay and business trips only." .

Even on an ordinary weekday in early December, bus services were clearly insufficient to meet the demand. Local buses to Arima were packed like sardines, while the very few available daytime JR bus services seem always fully booked. - This hotel provided a real experience of Japanese culture. An efficient transport service collected us from the Arima Onsen bus station to the hotel. Staff were helpful and spoke English. Good hot spring facilities, alongside a private hot spring chamber available for rent at a most reasonable rate for those who preferred it. We absolutely enjoyed the varieties of Japanese cuisine offered in the excellent Dinner and Breakfast which are included in the room rates. A delightful parade of nice shops was just 5 minutes' walking distance from the hotel." .

On arrival it was so cold that I kept blowing my hands while writing. The staff noticed this and went to get me a cup of hot tea to warm my hands. Then they led me to the room and briefly explained stuffs. They also helped arranged a wonderful dinner at the Japanese restaurant Seto, with special instructions as I cannot eat meat. The dinner was amazing and the restaurant faced the glittery Osaka bay. Using Google translate, the waiter was able to explain the seasonal ingredients used. Beautiful table wares used, very pleasant indeed. I had the twin room facing the Osaka bay. It was very relaxing, sipping tea as you enjoy the view. Room is big, amenities were good including pajamas. At the top of the hotel is an open terrace where you can view Osaka bay at night and sunrise. Getting to hotel was easy, there's a loop bus stopping right at the hotel side. There's a free shuttle from the hotel to the Rokkomichi JR station and Rokko Hankyu station. The view along the way was beautiful. Breakfast selection was amazing with variety especially the Japanese side. They also labelled the ingredients e.g. allergens like eggs, wheat, meat, alcohol, seafood etc. They have dessert for breakfast. Check out is at 11 am, not the usual 10 am. From start to end, their service was excellent!" .

The hotel is also situated right beside the Ropeway which leads up to the Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens - a nice place to spend a relaxing morning/afternoon! If you have a bit more time, you could take the Ropeway up (buy a one-way ticket), spend some time exploring the Garden which stretches all the way down to the mid-way station of the Ropeway, then from there follow the walking trail to the Nunobiki Waterfall, have a little picnic, then continue down the trail back to the Hotel. There are also quite a number of restaurants at the shopping arcade at the lower floors of the hotel. We had one of our dinners at the Wakkoqu Shin-Kobe outlet - one of the best in Kobe for a Kobe Beef experience :) Generally the room was very comfortable, clean, and our room was facing the harbour - so it was really lovely! All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel." .

        hip:hasText  "- nothing remarkable other than the view and staff quality - outdoor private onsen practically has no view at all. Bamboo fences and roof covered up almost every nice view the onsen should have - no difference in terms of view for the four different outdoor private onsens. Trying just one is practically enough - the private onsens are always full. You cannot practically enjoy any of them at all unless during inconvenient times - I booked this hotel because of its fame for Michelin one star dinner course. I am really disappointed with the food as the taste and portion are really average, if not below average. Many onsen hotels serve far better course with better portion than this hotel - really expensive in terms of accommodation and food. For one night stay with dinner and breakfast, I was being charged 77000 yen for two person. During my stay in osaka I went to onsens in shirahama which are far better and value for money in comparison. I would suggest going there instead of onsens in this area. - + room on 5/F with good view overlooking the town. Gorgeous view at night seeing cities far away like stars shining on mountains + most staff have good english and chinese skills + onsen only one hour bus from osaka which is convenient" .

The room photos online are accurate to a T. The rooms were nice and new, separate showers and bathtub areas. You can expect top quality even down to coffee/tea & toiletries in the room.

However, given this is a large hotel, with a lot of guests, and a lot of staff, some of the staff just were not as knowledgable about things as one would expect. This is why we rate the staff below expectation--- There were very service oriented- but some just did not seem to know some basic things that a hotel staff member should know. - The rooms were spacious, by Japanese standards. The rooms we had were over 30 sq meters, and this makes the room feel much more livable, especially if you have two people in the room, and you stay a few nights. The view looking over the harbour was great. Really pretty in the early am and in the evening. Worth it to get the view overlooking the water. The hotel facility overall was good. The location worked fine for us. That particular location has some advantages, aside from the stunning view. However, it is important to know that to get to the main train station in Kobe, Sannomiya-eki, it is a 15 to 20 minute walk. If you like to walk, this is fine. Our entire family likes to walk, so this was fine for us. But if you do not enjoy walking every time you go out of the hotel- then- for this location- you either have to a) use a taxi to get to the station or surrounding areas, or b) stay at another hotel, in another location." .

The lobby is on the second floor and you need to catch a small elevator to 2nd floor to check in. English is spoken well here. Perfect location, we had a great time. Would recommend and I would stay here again👍 - The hotel is conveniently located next to Chinatown shopping and restaurants. Also close to shopping mall with hundreds of shops and restaurants that I could not possibly see them all. The hotel is also close to the rail station. Everything you need is within walking distance of the hotel. They have a café downstairs next to hotel, With the best ham sandwich and latte for 460 yen. There is also a seafood sandwich shop on the other side of the hotel with the best crab sandwich I have ever had. A little pricey but excellent. Family Mart is right outside the hotel for items you forgot or a fast take out food. An ATM is also at very Family Mart. The hotel offers free drinks for guests in the afternoon to midnight in the comfortable lounge area. The beds were very comfortable. The blanket very soft and fluffy." .

The same can be said about the Herb Garden ropeway which has signs towards it from the hotel." .

In the past 6 months traveling around Asia we have always been given 2 complimentary bottles of water each day. Here we had to pay extra for water in what is suppose to be a 5 star hotel (and priced as such). The bed was the hardest we have ever had. It was so hard that the carpeted floor was more comfortable. We tried sleeping on the doona but it didn't help. The pillows are also hard. Check in wasn't permitted until 3:00pm but instead of completing the check in process when you arrive you were just told to go away and come back at 3:00 pm (although they would store you luggage). So everyone returned at 3:00 pm only to find that we all had to complete the usual paperwork. Why not do the check in process when you arrive but don't allocate a room until they are ready at 3:00 pm? Very unusual inefficiency from the Japanese. Breakfast is unbelievably expensive and not that memorable. We ended up taking a stroll each morning to some great restaurants nearby and had better breakfasts at about 25% of the cost. Drinks in the mini bar and hotel bar are also very expensive. If this was an Excelsior Hotel I would understand it but the hotel is in need of some serious maintenance and is very tired. The rooms are very small and wardrobe space is almost non existent and there are no drawers for cloths so you have to unpack your undies from your suitcase every day. The bathrooms are tiny and in need of renovation and the furniture is well past their economic use by dates. - The hotel is located right on Kobe Port so we had a great view of the water and pier area. Kobe JR station is within a 15 minute walk and there are lots of very good restaurants and shopping malls within a short walk. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus that goes every 20 minutes in to the CBD (and back) so the entire town is within easy reach. Most rooms have a balcony and we spent a few evenings sitting outside admiring the port lights while sipping a cold beer or cold Sake (which we purchased from a nearby supermarket at 20% of the minibar price). The staff are very friendly and on par with all Japanese hotels. The internet is very fast and reliable." .

The best thing was you can easily find good restaurant and very close to harbour area for photos taking at night. The price was reasonable considering we stayed there on Sat and Sunday." .

We didn't know this and thought the price posted was the normal price, when we left the parking and ended up paying 5 times more than posted we inquired with the hotel which explained the situation to us and then located our payment stub and refunded us the difference. In almost any other hotel in the world, the hotel would usually snuff the clients with a \"oh well\" attitude. We were really appreciative that the staff here were so helpful. - The staff was extremely helpful, the most helpful part was when we found out that in order to get the parking price as posted on Booking.com, you had to tell the parking attendant/concierge which we didn't know. The staff worked tirelessly to find our payment stub and refunded us the difference." .

Dinner was horrible, we expected a great \"kaiseki\" (fine dining) dinner of kobe beef, but the beef was leathery and chewy, the meat wasn't 'melt in your mouth experience' and the chef didn't cook it properly so it was definitely not worth the price and it was such a MAJOR dissapointment 2. Facilities and the property itself is rather old and needs a major refurbishing 3. The hotel sold us bus ticket to Shin-Kobe station but for the wrong date (earlier date)!! we were panicking and almost left behind by the bus. Thankfully we managed to talk it out to the bus driver so the driver let us in. 4. Fair warning, there is no shower in each room, hence it's all shared japanese bathing on 2nd floor (our room is at 3rd floor). 5. There is no elevator in the property so people with disabilities would have a very hard time getting in to the room After all, not worth the experience, would go somewhere else to try kobe beef and other ryokan experience. - Location is next to the bus station." .

The many wall glass shelves were very convenient and nicely designed. The Hotel Okura lobby was huge and looked elegant. I love the hotel lounge lobby here." .

Japanese breakfast very good and had rolls with butter and Jam. Has coin washing machine and dryer, vendor machines, and microwave. Used the microwave for ready made meals from convenience stores or supermarket and ate at tables and chairs at reception which was convenient. Easy to find despite it being away from main station area. Walking from Sannomiya station takes about 15 min with luggage. Get directions from tourist info. Once on main road and you have walked passed fire station turn right and you will see the hotel opposite a playground. Can get a day ticket for loop bus and hop on and off to see around Kobe. Easy to use subway. Nice day trips to Osaka by train using Jr pass. Amazing station in Osaka. Sake museum is a must with sake tasting." .

The breakfast room is very cramped, we got tiny coffee cups, plastic juice glasses, a mono choice of juice and strange tasting scrambled eggs as though they had been prepared in a pan that had not been properly cleaned. One-off experience maybe. The décor of the hotel is somewhat tired and sullen, and I didn't like the open air corridors. The hotel has an innner courtyard, all floors open on to this courtyard. Which means that when it's 5°C outside, you get to freeze while waiting for an elevator to take you down to the heated reception/breakfast area. The neighbourhood of the hotel is non-descript, quite ugly even. The comfort level was mediocre. A small bed (140cm) despite the high price, scratchy towels, hard pillows and a very narrow 140cm-wide bed cover (this was a first). No English speaking TV stations for foreign travellers, very annoying. Lastly, I thought the 3pm access to the room was over-doing it. In ALL of the 9 other hotels in which we have stayed in Japan, we had access to our room at 2pm. - The principal highlight of this hotel is that it is a 5 minute walk from Sannomiya station where you can jump on JR local trains to Osaka and Kyoto et al. There are a ton of shops and several department stores quite close to the train station, and restaurants galore. Although, not many offering western food. This is Kobe beef country. If you like Kobe beef, despite its fat content, then you are going to be very happy. Ample breakfast and good pastries." .

Not the hotel's fault, but I found it difficult to reach from Shin-Kobe thanks to lack of information. You need to leave the station and walk through a shopping mall, eventually finding a lift that takes you down to the underground/subway for Sannomiya. Then Sannomiya itself is a highly confusing place, with multiple stations clustered together and limited information. It was hard to even tell what direction I was facing! There are a few maps around, but the landmarks they highlight don't match those chosen by Google Maps so that wasn't a great help either. You need to get to near the Kobe Mint building - there are a number of large walkways crossing the main road here. Go across the walkways and head east/left to Round 1, then turn right. It's relatively easy when you know the route but was quite confusing at the time. Drinks facilities in the room are a water heater (not a kettle, so a bit faffy for my mind) and one teabag. Underwhelming for a Brit used to simple and endless tea supplies! Not a big issue though. If you need to wash clothes, it's 10 minutes to the nearest coin laundry or pay hotel dry cleaning prices. - As usual for APA Hotels, it's got good-quality and straightforward facilities. There's also a Seattle Coffee onsite (although only open until 9pm) which is good for taking it easy in the evening without going anywhere." .

        hip:hasText  "The hotel is slightly out of the way, but that's a small matter as there's a shuttle bus to ferry passengers from the hotel to sannomiya station and back and also shin Kobe and back. - I asked for a higher floor the guest officer said that for the rate we paid that was usually not possible. She asked for time to check and when she returned I was delighted to learn that the hotel had upgraded us to oval club floor sans the lounge. This was a real bonus as the room was spacious and luxurious. A small gesture that meant a lot to us. The view of the port city was excellent from the room and though we stayed for just a night, the stay will likely be the most memorable of our entire trip. I also commend the good service at the front desk and of the bus captain who drove us to the shin Kobe station. He was polite, helpful and punctual on arrival and in sending us within the stipulated time, to our destination. The hotel is close to IKEA and conference Centres and a must is the UCC coffee museum and cafe which makes coffee that is Out of this world! The other option to move around is the port liner station that is less than five minutes walk from the hotel and marked out by a covered path. I also recall the hotel concierge presenting us with umbrellas as it was raining all through our stay. He offered he umbrellas before we even asked. Overall the hotel offers excellent service and is a worthwhile choice for visitors. My only regret is not trying out the facilities (gym and restaurants as that may have completed a pwrfect stay)" .

It has grace and charm and a timeless, classic feel that is comfortable and graceful.

        hip:hasText  "Where to begin. Mostly it was the staff. A promise of free parking is what would have made this a good value for our money. Instead, after requesting and confirming parking, I wasn't allowed to use it until 10:00pm, when check-in was 3:00pm. I was told rudely to move my car around 6:00pm. We had already had a very long day of travel and my husband was even taking a nap. This was after we were told we couldn't park there after checking in at 3:00, so we went to a local mall for a while and paid around 800 yen to park there for a couple of hours. But we were told we could park there \"later\" so I figured around 6:00 would be okay. The spot was vacant. The staff was very rude in asking me to move my car as well. I even waited a couple of weeks to write this review to make sure I would simmer down a bit and be as fair as possible in retrospect. We ended up parking at a cheap paid parking lot all night because the spot wasn't available until 10:00pm. After paying for all of this parking a business hotel would have been a significantly better value because the hostel also happened to be very loud. I woke up around 4:00am to lots of loud voices and banging noises. It's worth noting that the hostel is part of a bar/restaurant as well. While this is probably fun if you are just there to hang out, it wasn't great for sleeping. The sleeping area was hard with a thin futon, but the pillow was better than most places I've stayed in Japan. I have lived here more than two years and never been so dissatisfied with a hostel. If we didn't have another 5 hours to drive (after driving 6 already) to get home we would have just left after being asked to move our car at 6:00pm. Now to be fair, if you didn't have a car to worry about, the place would have been much better. I feel as though I tried to account for that with reserving the spot ahead of time, but I suppose that didn't actually count. - The sleeping room had a fair amount of privacy given that it was a 10 bunk room. The best part was that the shower and toilet are in the same room as the beds, so no wandering around in a strange place at night." .

The check-in staff did not make us aware of any hotel amenities, and we didn’t find them signed either. The hotel is within an enormous six-story indoor/outdoor shopping/food court mall. The mall was run-down, dated, and mostly deserted including all of the restaurants. The only saving grace was that while exploring the bowels of the basement we stumbled on a grocery store. The grocery was busy, efficient, lively, and of good quality, but completely disassociated with the hotel six floors above. The view of mechanical equipment from our room was not desirable, but the Ropeway just outside provides a better view of the city if you get the chance to visit it. Our room was very hot and the windows did not operate so the staff allowed us a small desk fan run in the room. Overall I would not recommend nor return. The hotel did not have the ambiance nor amenities to warrant the luxury price. - The benefit was the location. The hotel is a short walk from the Shin-Kobe; very convenient. Our ‘standard double’ room was clean and comfortable – having two chairs and a small table was appreciated." .

Given the high price that I was paying for my lodging, I was rather shocked we were not given something complimentary for the accusation, especially since no staff member had checked the stall before coming to accuse me.

This wasn't charged on arrival when you pay for the room, so was also a surprise when we checked out. - The location of the property was great. It is based in Meriken park, right next to the earthquake memorial and easy access off the expressway. The hotel has its own parking which is really helpful (although is ¥1600 for 24 hours). The staff are friendly as you would expect and the reception area of the hotel is stunning. We were there in December and they had a beautiful Christmas tree and accessories. As you go up the lift to your room there are great views of the reception area. We stayed with a toddler and requested a cot.

I would have paid extra for that if it was an option. - We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We had VIP treatment from the beginning to end from our hostess, Waka-san. She served our meals in our room, set up the futons, took our luggage and saw us off. The traditional Japanese meals, dinner and breakfast, were beautifully presented and the dishes complemented one another. Our room included two massage chairs that massaged almost from head to toe. I ended up using it four times. The onsen was nice and very relaxing. The bubbling hot spring water was brown so nothing could be seen below the waterline, for those who are shy." .

I'd say 99% of population wouldn't mind, but a light sleeper might. - Great location, adjacent to Kobe Station and Kosoku-Kobe Station. Room was comfy and was nicely sized.

I couldn't find a cheaper hotel of the same quality in Kobe but in other locations in Japan I've stayed at cheaper hotels with a similar quality of service. - Excellent location near Kobe station. There was a general high-quality and luxurious feeling about the hotel and the rooms. The bedroom had a huge tv which was much appreciated. It is worth noting that there was a pornographic tv channel enabled by default which would be a problem if staying with children. It is of course possible that they enabled this channel because of the age of myself and my partner but I didn't ask if that was the case." .

Views are amazing. The staff kindly moved us to a different room on our request, as we were on a high floor during a typhoon and it was very creaky. The second room was much nicer than the first, and much bigger. Perhaps this was compensation as when the staff first tried to move us, they acccidentally took us to, and walked us right into, a room which was clearly already occupied. We had a massage in our room, which was lovely. The room was on offer, and therefore good value." .

This hotel has 3 different sets of different slippers for different area, which is fine but can be tricky at one of the indoor onsen where you have to mind your step walking up the stairs to reach, if you have big feet and the slippers does not fit, it could be quite tricky. The hotel itself gives off a very commercial vibe with private bath reservation at a charge. Dinner was quite nice but breakfast was quite basic. This review is partly in comparison with other ryokan i have stay elsewhere in japanese but if i am to visit Arima Onsen again perhaps i would opt to pay more and expect better. - As a ryokan it does what it says. Staff are all very attentive. They always seem to know where you are going and who you are despite it is a massive hotel." .
