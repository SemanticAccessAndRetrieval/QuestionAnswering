The window into the shower is a little bit unusual for anyone from North America (I've seen this in other hotels in Asia and Europe), but you can always close the blind! - The service and cleanliness at this hotel is impeccable. It is a smaller boutique style hotel, so keep this in mind when you book. There is no fitness room, pool or other amenities you may expect with a larger chain. Instead you are offered a more personal and local experience. The hotel is very new and the rooms reflect this. The bathroom in our 2 bed suite was incredible with great water pressure and very good shower heads. Wifi is great in the room. Also the location is excellent, 5 minutes walk from Karasuma-oike station with quick access to Kyoto station. Also, I just want to say it is the little things that make a hotel experience great. Many hotels charge for every little thing, but the fact this hotel gave us 4 free bottles of water every night was very much appreciated." .

The rooms I used were spacious but you need to pay more for bigger rooms." .

The staff cannot speak very good English, but it's OK and they try and were always pleasant. - The location of this hotel is excellent. It is less than 10 mins from Nishiki Market and there are a lot of good Japanese restaurants around the hotel. The staff are very accommodating. It is about 100m to the nearest underground /subway/metro. It is not easy to spot the hotel entrance, so look out for the 7-Eleven. The main entrance is next to the 7-Eleven and you have to go down a small \"corridor/alley\" to get there, OR you can walk through the 7-Eleven. There is also a Lawson and a Doutor (cafe) opposite the hotel. They have an eco-cleaning service, i.e. if you don't need your room to be cleaned for the day, you can put a card outside your door and they will refund 300Yen for that day. They will change your towels though and give you the basic amenities. They provide shampoo, shower gel and conditioner (Shiseido). There is a small mini fridge, a washing machine/dryer (I didn't try it though) and a safe. They gave good directions on where to take the bus to visit some sites. There is also a public bath and you need a code to get in. If you need total peace and quiet and blackout curtains, this place is not for you. If you just need a decent place to sleep while on holiday, this hotel is bang for your buck." .

The venue is great easy to get to by subway,, right across the road the art museum and MOMAK and canal full of cherry blossom, great Japanese food close by and very reasonably priced. Also hotel has own Onsen in basement, very clean and great after day walking shrines and temples! Lovely friendly staff and always respectful and helpful! Would highly recommend!" .

The hot tub on the roof has a nice view, but is really small and 2 people in the tub make the water flow over the bath tub edge. Our room was ok size but had no view at all. It felt a bit like being in a dark cave, and smelt a little sticky. We couldn't even open the window, because we had smells from the kitchen evaporating into our room, and we weren't sure if that might attract rodents to crawl into the open window. We didn't see any though, so it was more of a worry we had. There are probably nicer rooms in the hotel on the higher floors. But we weren't happy with ours on the first floor! The staff was super friendly so no complains, they were also cleaning up the room properly every day, but the stickiness remained nonetheless. The breakfast that we ordered for one of the 2 nights we stayed there, was very good. Not really my taste, but I can appreciate the style and the quality of the food we were served. I would have appreciated a choice of different style food, but everybody gets a preset menu and you have to decide the day before at what time you will eat the breakfast. 7.30, 8 or 8.30. The system doesn't offer much flexibility. So don't get to much in vacation mode. Get up and go to breakfast, hurry. Keep in mind check out time is 10, not 11 like in most hotels, and they make, in a clear yet friendly way sure you follow that timing they have. - The Location is good, close to a huge variety of restaurants, bars and a few cafés, a very touristic area of course and quite pricy, but then again what isn't in the middle of Kyoto. That is what you get going there and was to be expected, so no complains." .

And the reason for making such a statement is that Yoko-san and Akira-san are just such a nice people! They are remarkable!!! During the whole stay at Kyoto we had a felling that we were visiting relatives or having a homestay but not staying at a guesthouse. My wife got injured prior to our trip to Japan so I asked for the wheelchair, not really expecting to get one, but when we finally got there it turned out that Yoko-san made a reservation for the wheelchair at the special service and even gave us a ride there after accomponying us to the local clinic. The room itself was really wide comparing to other hotels I had stayed in Japan and it was spotlessly clean and all amenities were brand new. The staff is also nice and well-trained and able to provide a tourist all neccesary information if needed. For me and my wife hotel is just the place where you can spent a night after busy day most of the time, unless you have such a nice hosts like Yoko-san and Akira-san, whos hospitality is just on another level. 11 out of 10 for us! Thanks for everything and special regards from my wife. Looking forward to see you again next time in Kyoto." .

Ideal for a dynamic stay in the city, it is not the type of hotel where you go to spend a lot of time using its services, because they are simple. You go there for a good rest after a day out. Room service has few options. Location is good, near to Kyoto Station, but not that beautiful surroundings. Magnificent temple across the street. Seven eleven next door." .

Rooms were clean, comfortable, modern and looked very new, loved the bathroom too. Breakfast was yummy and even had about twenty something flavor of ice creams to choos from. The cake shop sold wonderful desserts which were not pricey at all. It was mummy's birthday one day and we came back to a sweet note with cakes on her coffee table that night. Totally made our stay in Kyoto" .

Specifically, I could only open my suitcase on the small double bed, there was very little floor space. Not disappointed with the hotel or service, but the price is too high; even for Kyoto. - Liked the small things like multiple charger for phone/device charging in the room, and the large bathroom. The tiny 1.5 person seat was a nice touch, but at the sacrifice of floor space." .

The view was basically of a fairly beat up city. The AC unit in the room was incredibly noisy but when shut off it wasn't that cold in the room. Shower had bad water pressure. Bathroom was beautiful otherwise. Each room came with all the standard soaps, robes and towels you'd expect. Basic television. Staff didn't help people up to their room but they weren't that hard to find and plenty of elevators. Finding something to eat in the local region was pretty easy. Finding other supplies was also fairly easy one just needed a map. Basically a good average hotel. Not really exceeding expectations but certainly not bad. A bit pricey. - The staff were really nice and spoke good English for a Japanese Hotel. Hotel was well placed for some temple exploring but still a fair distance from everything (About 40min walk from everything you'd want to actually see)." .

        hip:hasText  "Location has both positives and negatives. A massive positive is that the guesthouse is located on the doorsteps of the Southern Higayashima temples, shines and alleyways. It is very accessible to this beautiful area. Gion is also easily within walking distance! The only downside is that public transport (bus no. 206) can take almost the same time as walking to Kyoto Central Station (+25min walk). Unfortunately we struck a lot of rain (incl. Typhoon Lan) during our stay so our story may be an isolated case. In saying this, we would still stay at Guesthouse Soi!! - Staff were super helpful during our four night stay! The 500yen western breakfast was great value for money, particularly after eating traditional Japanese breakfasts in the weeks prior. We stayed in one of the traditional rooms with tatami mats. Although we had already stayed in ryokans, this was a great way to continue the experience on a more budget approach. This place is great vale for money!" .

The staffs are fantastic, breakfast incredible, and room a great combination of traditional taste and modern comfort. Definitely try the public bath tub." .

After check-in, I thought I'd have a quick shower, but discovered one long hair and a big pubic hair in the bathtub left from the previous occupant, which in hindsight made me recall that the room slippers appeared disheveled when we entered the room, so I knew the room had not been cleaned. Hotel quickly moved us to a room that was nearly double in size, which made a good impression. Wish we had been given that room from the beginning. Hallway in the 7th floor had a strange vinegar smell. This made me think there are a variety of cleanliness problems here. Disappointing for the money we paid. We weren't given an extra roll of toilet paper on our 2nd night, although there had been 2 rolls originally. A bit stingey, we thought. The breakfast is 1600 yen per person, a bit pricey for what was offered, and the huge poster in the elevator features a large photo of French toast, which never appeared on the actual breakfast buffet. Aside from all this, every staff member was helpful, kind, professional, and spoke to us in English when we couldn't understand in Japanese. I don't fault the staff at all. Very pleased with the service here, but felt the cleanliness might not be up to snuff. Too bad. It LOOKS like a nice hotel. - Very, very fluffy beds and bedcovers. We were in heaven with feather bed mattress covers and feather blankets. We wanted to just stay in bed all morning. Icy-cold air conditioning was great after a long day of sightseeing in the heat. It was too cold to keep on while sleeping. Very impressive. Lovely towels. Having a different color of towel from my travel partner was a nice touch. Daily bottled water was a nice touch. The staff were terrific! Very professional, and spoke English. Very easy to check in and out. They kindly held our bags for us when we arrived before check-in time." .

Most of the important sights are in this area and for others, it is very well connected by both Bus and Subway. You can buy a bus pass at the Hotel Lobby and start using it immediately without any hassle. Considering it is on the main road, It is very quiet and perfect for a sound sleep. Hotel is surrounded by great options for eating and even a McDonalds for your kids. Check out the Japanese Confectionary store running since the early 19th century to small hidden restaurants serving local specialities. On two FLoors they have Vending machines for free tea, coffee and ice. Also paid vending machines with beer, ice tea and other beverages. The lobby area has a shelf with local guides and various grooming accessories like shaving blades etc. They also offer Umbrellas without any charge to be returned later on. They also have a restaurant and Spa in the Hotel The rooms are small but have all the necessary amenities. From Bathroom slippers to Air purifiers and an amazing wifi speed. it has all been covered.

Might not be the definition of vacation for a lot of people. And they serve small pastries and small drink boxes in a small room. Reminded me of kindergarden a lot. The ventilation in the bathroom runs at everytime. Even if you pull out the room card. You can hear it in bed and of course you won't use the tub because the expierience is like lying in a bucket in a factory hall. - The little details in the rooms were nice. You don't just get soap and towels but also bodywash, conditioner, razors, cotton rounds, toothbrush, slippers, pyjamas, tea + electric kettle, free water from a cold fridge, a shoe horn... We also used the coin washing machine and dryer on the 2nd floor (for about 3-4€) We found this solution much nicer than in other hotels were you give all your stuff away for 1-2 days to laundry service. A bus gets you to the hotel from Central Station, a direct line gets you to the Bamboo Walk and the metro near the hotel goes to Osaka. All busses are near and you will have to use them otherwise it's way too far from the main attractions." .

Also you can take bus from Kyoto station to the guesthouse with just a couple of minutes walk. I like the furnishings in the room, especially you can wash and dry your clothes everyday. If you don't have much time for dinner outside, you can buy some food in the convenience store across the street and heat it in the microwave. The guesthouse owner is very considerate and provides instructions and suggestions of sightseeing route in details. My daughter likes him so much that she would run to see if he was in the office every day when we went back to the guesthouse." .

We came here for our honeymoon. Everything in the suite and common spaces is beautifully and thoughtfully designed. The first scent that greets you on walking into the room is the inviting aroma of the timber bath. The staff were very friendly. We had to make a last minute change to our booking due to some illness in the family and they accommodated our request without hesitation. The concierge gave us a personal tour of our room and they wrote a very sweet card for us." .

I never would consider paying almost $89 per person a night. We spent half of that at Ryokan with 2 meals included. We were charged full price for a child that should be free. I have seen prices as low as $127 a night for the very same room for the same number of people which is what we paid for a suite in a hotel in Hiroshima. (We are a family of 5 with a child that is 5 years old.) If you can book at this more reasonable range, it is well worth it. However, I would definitely look elsewhere if you want a more comfortable stay. - The staff was great. They were very friendly and accommodating. The location was fairly easy to get to from several key locations. The breakfast was delicious if you don't mind an aditional fee. The futons were what you would expect at any Japanese style hotel, however, we had to pull ours out the first two nights of our stay. Usually, they are set up for you. Overall, it was a pleasant stay." .

There was a kid in the dorm, running around all night long, and always left the door open. Also, there was a tour group, shouting and drinking all night long. There are only 3 shared restrooms. During my stay there, there was only one working. This hostel is far from the attractions and downtown. It takes 40 mins by bus. I don't recommend this hostel. - bus stop is just in front of the hostel. A supermarket within 5 mins of walking distance." .

If you are coming back late or from a different direction to they way you left make sure you keep the location app on on your phone so you can find your way back with google maps. I got lost for a good while trying to find it. More signposts in the area would be great as it's in a quiet area not on the main street. If you are coming with heavy luggage i would get a taxi as its about 15/20min walk from Sanjo station (depending on how fast you walk) - The beds were a double size which was great, a handy shelf ran along the side of the bed too. There were lockers in the room to store valuables and they could fit a cabin sized suitcase as well as a rucksack. Showers are all on one floor, always hot water and cleaned regularly. Breakfast facilities were so useful - breakfast every morning (toast/various buns, croissants/eggs/ rice/potato salad etc) was delicious, and they also had cooking facilities. Lots of tourist information boards/maps available giving you all the bus information to travel around the city." .

Checking staff were polite, but did not know how to give directions to major tourist attractions. Buses in Kyoto are difficult to navigate, so it would be helpful if they could help with directions. Would recommend taking taxi from Kyoto station the first time rather than bus or subway because it’s so difficult to find the right bus, and during rush hour the buses are stuck in traffic. The subways are not as well marked as in Tokyo." .

The problem was that there were only three beds, and two of them had men it them. As a result, I felt very vulnerable and asked to be placed in a room with another female. They told me they could move me the next night, but that night I had to stay in that room. The receptionist informed the owner that there was a private room available I could stay in that night, but he promptly shut her down and didn't offer me the room. That same owner told me that many women had complained of the same issue since they opened. It appalled me that they hadn't taken action to change the ratio situation if so many women had complained. That night I cried in the bathroom and then eventually went back to my room where I didn't get any sleep because I was so scared something would happen. The next day, they moved me to a room that had another female in it, but before doing so the female owner told me it was my fault for booking the room I was in and basically made me feel terrible. I have never experienced such poor customer service. Rather than compassionate, kind, and understanding service they blamed me. I was shocked at how they handled the whole situation. I will never recommend them to anyone. This could have been easily avoided: change my room the first night. By the time I inquired about changing rooms it was late in the evening. The owner let a room stay empty rather than try to calm my fears. He chose potential money over good customer service. That kind of service will not be successful. - The shower and bathrooms were clean." .

The dining options around the hotel seemed relatively limited and we would probably have preferred that it be in a slightly livelier neighborhood. Very close to Nijo castle, however, and seemed well served by the subway (which we never used). - We took the \"small room\" and were a little worried that it was going to feel cramped, but it was actually a very comfortable place to spend three days. I'm sure the larger rooms would have been even nicer, but we were happy with our choice. I wasn't sure an en-suite bathroom was included, but after seeing the small capsule bathroom I was happy to see that we had everything that we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the staff (even those who weren't 100% confident in their English) couldn't have been friendlier or more cooperative. The onsen was a great part of the experience and I can happily say that no one seemed troubled by my several large tattoos. I've heard that the general tattoo ban in onsens is often applied to westerners as well, but here I didn't see any signs forbidding tattoos and none of the other patrons seemed bothered. Finally, the free bikes were a huge bonus (although we were lucky to have gotten the last two available for the day at 8:30am, so you may want to make sure to get them early!) and we really enjoyed a nice (long) bike ride along the river to the Fushimi Inari shrine (the famous orange gates)." .

No surprises; except how wonderful it actually was. Immaculate. Secure. Friendly neighbors. Right down the street from the Nishiki Market.

        hip:hasText  "- Little space for two persons, very small bathroom, but ok if just for sleeping. - It'be nice to have more hangers for clothes or better a small wardrobe. - I'd prefer softer pillows. - - Really pretty and super clean rooms, nice new furniture, all is very comfortable. - Staff is friendly and helpful (one of them gave us a really cute origami as a gift) - Bathrooms stuff is GREAT: all the shampoos and soaps, plus for the ladies they have a face lotion, a toner and even hydrophilic oil face cleaner! You can get all the free bathroom utensils like toothbrush, etc. plus even rent a hair straightener. - \"Travel buddy\" - a free smartphone with 4G that works everywhere (even underground!) and all the needed android apps - We had a kettle in the room but always had tea at the dining room downstairs which is a very cosy and stylish place for socialising and rest. Tea and water, kitchen utensils are provided. - Locations is close to the metro station, ~5 min walking, and about 15-20 by walk to the kyoto train station. There are 3 convenience stores nearby, you're given a map with directions. Also, really close to Fushimi Inari temple." .

Located close to Kyoto, but some walking distance away was tiring (but not the ryokan's fault) - Everything was amazing, cold drinks on arrival, very responsive staff - they knew exactly what we needed at the right time. Bathing time was fun, and private. Much more than what I expected. Pictures don't do the room justice as they're much bigger than what you might imagine. Even gave us 2 umbrellas on our last day because it was raining heavily." .

Good AC Nice bathroom. The bathhouse and hot tub on the first floor was great and a nice option for bathing vs. 8 in one bathroom. Breakfast onsite was convenient and delicious. Location was superb to walk to many sites as well as easy to get bus and subway. Price was excellent and staff was very helpful and spoke English well." .

Room to room, yes you will hear it all and they will hear it all and worse, to the street, despite we had a room on the last and 7th floor. Mattress is so worn out that you will clearly feel the U shape from the start and pillows are just insane.

It was always crowded, noisy, and never very private. None of the food looked very appealing to me (I'm a special case: vegetarian). The hotel \"gift shop\" was a series of shelves on one side of the \"restaurant.\" Although the hotel was very clean and in adequate repair, the furnishings looked like they'd been chosen in the 1950s and never replaced. There were tiny ice machines at odd-level floors, giving you a cupful of ice when necessary. I was on the fourth floor, so getting ice meant I had to ride the busy elevator up and down; there no open stairways, unless you wanted to set off an alarm. Considering that hotel ice is not necessarily common in Japan, I guess I was lucky to have any at all. - The facility was clean and adequately attractive. There was just enough floor space in the rooms (more would've been better, but this was Japan, so it's not something you expect).The staff was competent and prompt. The room was serviced each day without fail between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM. Most importantly, this hotel was a very short walk away from Karasuma-Oike station, which could eventually get you to any train line in Kyoto." .

I would love to have had the option of having a traditional breakfast and/or dinner in the ryokan, but I just had to do more exploring for traditional food. While there are some bathroom amenities (toothbruth, shampoo, body wash) beware that there is no conditioner or body lotion if your hair, like mine, just dies without conditioner. Definitely not horrible critiques, but just things to be aware of. - Location is great, very close to Tokyo Station with access to buses, trains and the subway. This is definitely a quaint Japanese version of a B&B so don't expect all the hotel frills. It was a great, quiet, comfortable stay in a traditional ryokan. Be respectful and know the expectations (quiet, tranquility, no shoes past the front door) and you'll love your stay as much as we did. If sharing slippers with others disturbs you then just make sure to wear/bring socks. The available private onsen was very nice after a long day of walking. The staff was very nice and knew enough basic English for us to get by. When we returned from a long day of sightseeing, they brought cold tea to our rooms (without us asking!). The basic rooms were all we needed." .

Breakfast is good with a variety of breads, bed is comfy (I slept thru with at least 7 hours of sleep for my 3 nights there!). For the $ (<US$40) I paid, it is totally value for money." .

The bed is the biggest one that i have ever had in a hostel. And beside every bed there is a plug. You can recharge three electronic devices at the same time! That's wonderful for me! They also offer earplugs for free. In the morning they offer good breakfast. And Saeko is really good at making sandwiches :) She also gives me advices for where to visit in Kyoto and gives us gifts when we left. Thank you Saeko! Wish you happiness and luck too ('・ω・')" .

Pretty close to kyoto station. Has an underground station and several bus stops near by. The staffs are really friendly and gave me some good advice. There are a number of umbrellas for borrow." .

Tommy speaks very good english, insists helping us with carrying luggage upstairs and downstairs, welcomes us everyday after we came back, offers high quality Sri Lanka tea and toasted bread and helps us with reservation and diner decisions. Tommy is an awesome host. Not to mention the guest house itself. Tommy renovated the house himself, we can really enjoy a good view from our room. We can feel a sense of Japanese aesthetics in the house, a combination of modern and tradition. The location of the guest house is a 5 minutes walk from Jiro Station (2 stops from Kyoto Station). It was very convenient. Don't forget to try the Kura Sushi which is 2 minutes from the house and ask Tommy to reserve spots for you during peak hours." .

Despite my requesting when booking that the room not be on the busy street, it was on the busy street. Many rooms are on a side street. The busy street is a main road to popular Gion, so despite being several floors up traffic noise was quite noticeable. - Stylish foyer featuring a tall & exquisite Japanese vase. Most reception staff were helpful Japanese who could manage standard questions in English but nothing beyond that. Kudos: a French reception staffer with good English who also wrote down an address in Japanese characters for the taxi driver. Her good English was a big plus for an English-speaking customer (me)." .

Check in was quite rushed as if the staff member had been in a hurry...I even remarked that she was rushing me, to please slow down. - The room design is modern Japanese style, quite attractive and appealing. Fantastic bathroom with interesting textiles and finishes, and a wonderful round, deep cypress wood tub. Bed is low to the ground on a raised platform, and accent lighting is used throughout the room for dramatic effect. Be sure to request the larger of the two double room types available.

The symbols for the washing were in Japanese, so we went to the lobby to ask a staff member to help us read the signs (so that we would use the correct function and not ruin our clothes). He simply said \"nope\". No other explanations were offered. He then rudely told us that he will not come up and help us, and then turned around.

There are definitely great price options if you time it right, but seeing the difference, their higher rates seem a bit unreasonable for the lack of amenities. We managed without the elevator and were disappointed with the bath, but those things are just inconveniences if you aren't paying a lot for them. I wasn't sure where I went wrong during my booking so I didn't question the bill until I looked at the site again to compare, but next time I will definitely take a screenshot so that clarification can be made right away. I don't regret my stay at all, just my timing. I want the staff to know that I was happy in general with our stay, but couldn't communicate my confusion and disappointment due to a language barrier and lack of giving myself adequate time. - This is a clarification on a previous review. I was not aware that the 5 person family room did not take into account the ages of children unless you have more than 5 people. So there was no extra fee for the child, they were part of the 5 person accommodation. I stand by the review that this is a great place to stay if you can catch the lower rates. The staff is wonderful and the location is fairly convenient. Our family loved the quality of breakfast and the lobby/eating area decor was very nice. The size of the Japanese style room is very nice for mid to larger number of people if you don't mind futons versus beds. We prefer the open space and versatility of the Japanese style room." .

Every time I came back in the evenings, I was asked about my day, offered tea, toast and coffee, and every time I left in the morning I had a lovely breakfast and was sent off so kindly. Everyone always made sure I had everything I could possibly need. On the day it rained, Tommy-san insisted I borrow an umbrella, which was so much nicer than the travel one I had. The whole time I felt like I was staying with dear friends. There are all kinds of guidebooks in the living room with things to do around and how to get there from the guesthouse, maps, and bus passes available. When I misplaced my bus pass, Tommy-san said \"I have many bus passes!\" and simply gave me another one. It was so sweet and let me travel the day without worries until I found the other pass. I also had amazing free laundry service, my clothes smelled so good the rest of my trip. The location is great, a very easy 5 minutes or so walk to JR, metro and bus, getting around was very easy. If you need help finding your way, Tommy-san speaks perfect English to explain to you and draw you maps. I loved coming \"home\" in the evenings, the other guests were kind and considerate, it was great talking with other travelers. There was even curry for dinner! It is just such a warm, lovely place. The facilities are great and exceptionally clean, I never had trouble with the showers being full. In the dorm there was a huge locker with lots of hangers/hanger space, with included lock (but honestly I never locked it). Bed was spacious and the comfiest I experienced in Japan, the only mornings I needed my alarm because I slept like a rock. The dorm was cosy but never felt crowded, and as a female even in the mixed dorm I felt 100% safe. Guesthouse Oumi has everything you could need and you will be so taken care of. If there is a bed open, book it!" .

The room is cleaned and the towels and yukatas are replaced everyday, neatly kept on the tray. This level of perfection is not readily available in many hotels in the United States. Ryokan Kyoraku is indeed the best Ryokan in Kyoto! I will love to come back here again!!!" .

Also storage space was limited - one huge cupboard taken up with futon mattresses etc. Also we were disturbed by noisy neighbours - walls very thin! Overall though, we loved the room and had a great time. - Location was very good and hotel information about how to travel to temples etc very helpful. Room spacious and always clean. Didn't sample breakfast or dinner, so cannot comment on the food. We preferred to make our own plans and eat outside. Access to buses was easy from the ryokan and it was only an 8 minute walk to nearest subway station. Main shopping street a 10 minute direct walk from Ishicho.

        hip:hasText  "- when asking for items from concierge (international adapter, cork opener) we had to go down stairs to pick up. They didn't deliver to room. - asked concierge to point us in the direction of good bar district and cheap food. They recommended restaurants which were very expensive and had a relationship with them. Very unhelpful. - booking had to be paid upon checkin in person and not through credit card info I provided via booking.com. This caused a big confusion and the staff were unhelpful - staff sniggering in Japanese, very unprofessional - Have the option of renting bikes (1500 yen per bike per day). This was great for our 1 day stay because we could cycle through to shopping arcades, nishiki food market, gion district and inari gates all on the same day!" .

Other than that, we had no other issues. As per previous comments, we can't rate this hotel highly enough. - The Japanese practice sensational customer service and hospitality - which goes a long way to how much you enjoy any property. Although I'm used to Japanese rooms being small, the room at the Daiwa was much larger than anticipated. The proximity to Kyoto station was excellent. We are avid walkers and the walk to the Pontocho area, the markets and shrines was an easy 30 minute walk (flat ground and safe). The staff were exceptional at the hotel. The room was equivalent to any 5-star hotel I would pay for in Australia. These guys don't skimp on the amenities - great selection. We would definitely stay here again - without question or doubt." .

        hip:hasText  "Although I do enjoy my experience while staying in the hotel, it is fair to give (hopefully) a reasonable and fair review about the concerns that I had during my stay. Hotel: It may be hard to find a seat and not enough of outlets for guests to use when the lounge is busy at night. You may smell the odor from guests who smoke from the the smoking area while staying at the sky lounge if the doors are not closed properly. Potential Traveling Concerns: Note that if guests are comfortable and (or) used to traveling in busier cities such as Tokyo then the following issue would not be huge deal. Although the hotel is, in my opinion, quite close to the JR Nijo Station which is only two stations away from Kyoto Station, guests who are traveling with lots and (or) big luggage might struggle to find space on the train. This is because the trains might be full and guests may require to squeeze in and out of the train. - The price for a night was reasonable based on my experience! Hotel: The staff were extremely friendly and helpful! They greet you with a smile when you enter and leave the hotel. The free and unlimited drink services includes: coffee, corn soup (love it) and soft drinks at the sky lounge. Breakfast (offered between 7am to 9am) is free. The capsules are clean and comfortable. There is a coin-laundry machine (only accepts 100 yen, you can exchange the coins at the front desk) located on each locker room floor for each gender in the hotel. The public bathing area was nice and clean as well! If guests are not comfortable with the Japanese traditional bathing style, the area also includes two standing shower areas. Location: The closest JR train station is Nijo which is approximately a 7 to 9 minute walk if you found your way correctly. There are subway stations and bus stops nearby. There are some attractions near the hotel: a 2 minute walk from the Nijojo (Nijo Castle) and approximately 10 minutes away from the Kyoto International Manga Museum." .

(Unfortunately they only have 2 branches, both in Kyoto). From the second we arrived the staff were super friendly and helpful. Their English was great, and they were full of suggestions for places to see and eat at. When we had problems we needed help with (e.g. needing to call home to sort out a problem, or not sure how to go about sending our luggage on to the next hostel) they were so kind and ready to help. They ran events now and again to get people to make friends, have fun, and get into Japanese food and culture - a takoyaki night, a Halloween night, an okonomiyaki night, etc. I had been worried these might get loud or go on late, but they never did. Compared to the other hostels we stayed at in Japan (which were just fine) the facilities here were fantastic. I had packed a hairdryer, but I needn't have worried here - there are simple hairdryers in the rooms, and better ones in the toilet/sink area, and even more down by the shower area. Towel swaps for free, so you don't have to spend your precious yen and try stretch out one wet towel all week. Plenty of toilets and showers, which were clean and spacious. I personally never had to wait around for the shower to be free here. Mini sinks in your room so you can brush your teeth in your own room, or you can go to the bigger sinks out in the communal area. The beds were bigger and much less hard than the ones in our other hostels, and with more comfy pillows - they even allowed you to swap out pillows for whatever kind you preferred (thinner or larger). And there were no awkward or rickety bunk bed ladders to try navigate here; there were steps instead, which doubled as shelf space for us. The breakfast was great, as you could have both a Japanese style breakfast or a more Western..." .

Breakfast too expensive. Good internet." .

There was barely space to get to the bed, and the window was blackened out with cardboard (because there would not have been a view or sunlight anyways due to the next equally tall building being 0,5 metres away and the room being on a middle floor). It felt like a prison cell- maybe ok for one night, but for 4 nights very depressing. After going back to reception I got a room looking out the front which was fine. Wifi was very slow- enough to send e-mails or chat without attachments, but pics would only go through after several tries and minutes of waiting. - Very good location, convenient starting point for sightseeing all over Kyoto. The area around the hotel is also worth strolling around (eg Nishiki market). Small but clean room, good facilities. As usual in Japan horizontal spaces were lacking (esp. in the bathroom), but it was manageable. For late night cravings: convenience store right next door, can even be entered from the hotel lobby :) The price for the room was ok, but only after the switch to the slightly bigger room at street side with a not blackened out window/sunlight. Would have felt like a ripoff for the other one." .

Knowing that reception would be closed from 5pm and that we needed to check-out the next morning before reception opened at 9am, we cut our last day of sightseeing short and arrived back at 4pm to collect the parcel. To our horror, reception was already closed - with no explanation as to why! I used the emergency intercom and was able to get someone to come back to get my parcel from reception for me, though I had to wait for over an hour. While the rest of our stay at Orient Gojozaka was very pleasant and I would still recommend it, this experience was disappointing. - We arrived prior to check-in time, and were able to leave our luggage (which was then moved to our room for us when it was ready). The staff were friendly and the room itself was great for the price with a kitchen area, washing machine and free-to-use PC. A set of instructions were provided for all electronics in the room, in English and Chinese. Note that reception is only available between set hours (9am to 5pm).

The next day the made us a more \"Western\"style breakfast which was also interesting. However, we preferred the Japanese one and when I ask for it the day before, they told me it was not possible and they gave us on our third breakfast a combination of the 2 styles which was too much food and made us feel embarrassed to leave so much food behind. But worst thing about the breakfast was that we felt that our 2 year old son was not accounted for when serving us breakfast. In fact, they barely provided anything for him...this definitely was the most disappointing part of our stay. In the end, a great experience, we thoroughly enjoyed but really overpriced...but that seemed to be the case for all hotels in Kyoto specially during Golden Week. - A wonderful experience of staying in a ryokan! My family and I enjoyed this experience very much and loved the tatami mats, specially our 2 year-old son." .

But the efficiency and quality of the accommodations made up for the small size. - Modern and very new hotel in a location close to major shopping and dining. Ten minute can tide from the Gion district. The room was very small but efficient. We paid extra for a bathroom view to a moss and plant covered decorative wall. Worth the price. The staff were very accommodating and helped us everyday with travel directions. We would say that this high level of service made our stay all the more enjoyable. Breakfast each day can be purchased as part of the room rate which made it affordable. You have a choice of Japanese or American. Without the vouchers, the breakfast is costly and not with the money. We found a great Japanese noodle place ( small and informal) a block a way from the hotel. A hearty dinner( or lunch) can be had for two people for under $30. The hotel provides a list of neighborhood restaurants from which you can choose a place to eat. All price ranges, cuisines and levels of formality. We enjoyed our stay at the Solaria very much and would definitely return." .

Washing machine and dryer are in the room. The hotel is situated in a quiet tradional area giving visitors a feeling of living with the locals. Many of the attacions are within walking distance. Kyoto and Tofukuli staions are close by making other places like Nara, Hemeji and even Miyajima within eazy reach. Just be reminded that you sort your rubbish as the Japanese do." .

I would also would like to personally thank Miyuki Onishi for her professionalism for organising the 4th floor room into a Japanese Style Room as I have been advised it was normally a western style room on the 4th floor.

They did not offer to put in a regular chair to sit on, no cups and trash bins in the sink area, the comforters were covered with 1 fitted sheet which only covered the side that touched our bodies and came off during the night. Luckily I googled what to expect in a ryokan because no one explained anything to us about the kimonos, etc. in the room. if they are going for authenticity, remove the TV, fridge, brochures in the room and put a place to sit so I could put on my socks! It did not feel Zen-like in the entrance. Instead, it looked like a small store display with souvenirs and pictures from others guests, brochures. Too busy looking. The yard/ garden needed that Zen feel as well. No one told us anything or asked how the rooms were, if we needed anything. There is not a place we could walk to for meals. - It was my first ryokan experience. I like the lemons in the bath. Staff were nice in the end with help w/ our luggage and letting us wear kimonos and taking our pictures. They called a taxi for us. There was tea in the room." .

I traveled with 5 family member, when we arrived the staffs greeted us so warmly, they were all really friendly and helpful, they gave us a lot of guidance about the city, at one point we had to take a cab and it was raining, one of them even went an extra mile by showing us to the door and helped us talked with the cab driver about the address that we are going to visit, she even waited until we are inside the cab and it was raining, this is something that I rarely seen anywhere. and also at one point I asked them to file a complaint about this taxi that me and my family rode from Gion to the Hotel, normally it would only cost us about 1000 yen, but this particular cab driver took us around and charged us 2840 yen, when i got into the hotel, I told the staffs at the front desk about it and they were all gave a very prompt response and helped us immediately by calling the cab company, then the representatives of the cab company came and refund half of the cab fares. this hotel is truly recommended! I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here and not anywhere else when you're visiting Kyoto." .

The card key also was necessary to get the elevator to work. I felt less secure - elevator doors not visible to front desk. - Good location - a few blocks to the large shopping streets, the all-important 7/11s and also the subway. Not many English speakers on the staff - but once I located them they were helpful forwarding luggage, confirming reservations etc. Bed - great, pillows - excellent. 2 elevators, less waiting." .

Read before that hosekeeper does not make the bed, so I was not surprise. However, it alternated between two housekeeper, so one day it got made, the next day it did not. Being a budget hotel, the receptionist handled everything, including guiding on breakfast, which were just toasts and eggs, free flow coffee though. You gotta bring your own flask down to the reception for hot water, DIY of course. The ladies at the reception were more helpful, the younger ones were better in English. The old men were more stern, usually on night shifts and not smiling much, unless you are a Japanese man who will speak to them in Japanese. Male superiority runs in their old culture. You check in via a machine and you check out via a machine too. All in all, for the budget, it's value for money." .

The restaurant is something you would expect to find in a very high end hotel with a full wine room.

The shop at the entrance and also bar at reception is beautiful!" .

I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and I like the area, too. STAFF: friendly, efficient and helpful. I came to Kyoto from Kansai Airport by a MK shared taxi and wanted to go to the airport the same way so I approached the front desk for assistance the day before departure. The lady who made the phone call for me found out that it was too late, MK would not take me. She told me where to go to secure a seat on the limousine bus for my airport trip. Thank you so much. I had a more comfortable seat while paying less, not to mention it was a shorter ride. ROOM & FURNITURE: a clean and quiet room of 18 square feet giving me plenty of space, no fear of tripping off my bags. The comfy bed gave me very good rest. And I don’t think you can get the wide desk elsewhere. I still remember the one-seater sofa which is genius design. See the “table” on the arm rest. I sat there to enjoy my tea and八ツ橋(Japanese cinnamon snack Yatsuhashi). The COLLAPSIBLE STOOL was very useful. You can sit there to remove your shoes. LOBBY: high ceiling, natural light, elegant design; easy to spot the lift. EXTERIOR: The hotel building has a more attractive look than the couple of hotels in the area. BONUS: Shiseido MASKS" .

        hip:hasText  "The only major negative with our stay at K's House was that the beds were very, very hard. I'm a person who likes beds that are very firm, but the problem with the beds (I traveled with a brother and a sister and they both said the same,) is that the mattresses were old and worn and didn't provide much cushion at all between one's body and the wooden slats of the bed at all. If these were good-quality futons we'd have had no complaint. A minor negative was that the rental bicycles were maintained in poor condition. There is a bicycle rental shop a couple blocks straight west on Shichijo-dori that we wish we'd have seen earlier, because with the often-crowded pedestrian traffic a good bicycle is essential for safety. Mine had crooked handlebars and under-inflated tires. A minor negative because bicycles are external options, but they could be improved. - Aside from two negatives, everything - literally everything - about K's House was perfect, honto ni kampeki desu. The staff were wonderful, friendly, helpful, knowledgable and offered a wealth of suggestions when needed. The front desk is kept open until 2am - important, since our plane arrived at Nagoya in the evening and navigating the local train station, then the massive Shinkansen station in Nagoya was very difficult when the information desks at the stations were all closed for the night. We were worried about arriving after hours (around 11pm,) but the reception desk was open and receiving other late arrivals as well, so we had no need to worry. The second floor lounge and terrace are great places to relax, and the rooftop patio has excellent 360-degree views. In addition to the Kyoto Station and Kyoto Tower, you can see the Kiyomizudera temple off to the east, the roof of the Higashi Honganji temple straight west, and the entire ring of mountains to the east, north and west of the city. The shared bathroom facilities were always kept spotless - though other irresponsible guests couldn't be bothered to clean their own hair out of the sinks, and had the annoying habit of storing their toiletries right there on the sink-tops. (I can only hope that while they were in Japan these spoiled, entitled mentalities were able to learn about personal responsibility from the admirably self-disciplined Japanese people.) Despite the slobbishness of some of the other guests, we had no complaints about the washrooms, and never had to wait to use anything. The cafe and bar adjacent to the lobby are enough to make K's House a must-stay all on their own. Breakfast is your choice of four items from a group of something like eight for $5 USD, with unlimited juice, milk and coffee included. We ate breakfast there every day and the food was fresh and perfect every time." .

Had read in other reviews that it was a little hard to find, but we didn't have any difficulty. Showed taxi driver a picutre of it (having hotel name at the top of the building in big letters helped) and he took us right near it and directed us just up the road to where the hotel is. Hotel was very modern and super-clean. Room was small (as we were expecting), but clever use of space made it work well. We stayed in the North Tower which has its own entrance, a very short distance away from the South Tower on the opposite side of the pedestrianised walkway and we walked across to it to have breakfast each day The hotel felt secluded and private because of this position, yet right in the heart of Kyoto. Staff were polite, kind and very helpful (as we found Japanese people in general). Advised us on how to get around the city and helped us plan our trip. Great breakfast buffet!" .

The price is quite high and it's definitely a luxury property but the only thing you really get is a public bath in the basement. There is a \"restaurant\" on property which is always something I look for because I'm a solo traveler that likes to grab a quick bite at the hotel sometimes, but it can hardly be called a restaurant. It's only open for breakfast and sometimes not even that. The breakfast isn't included and is quite pricey. The hotel has no room service and no bar to have a drink. On top of that there is no mini bar - just an empty fridge. So if you're wanting food or a drink at the hotel any time outside of breakfast hours, you're out of luck. That seems a bit strange to me for a property of this size and quality. - The room was the perfect size for me and I liked the design of the bathroom. There was a good kettle and tea pot for green tea in the morning which I liked. The location was very nice. Walking distance to Gion and close to the subway to see other sights. There's also a hotel across the street that is larger and serves as a pick up location for some of the city's organized tours. There were lots of restaurants and bars just outside the hotel. The hotel is obviously new and quite modern which is nice. I usually opt out of having my room cleaned and if you do they leave a bag at your door with fresh towels and toiletries which is nice. That's the first time I had seen that." .

It was a nice bonus to have a fridge. A good combination of traditional ryokan (futons, availability of the public bathhouse) and the conveniences of a modern hotel." .

Nothing remarkable. - Sakura Terrace The Gallery is a good option for urban travelers visitin Kyoto. So close to the JR Station (5 mins walking) wich means a very good connections to everywhere. The space at lobby floor is great and the stairs and the garden have a kinda NY smell inspiration, so is great to be there. The rooms are huge for Japan standards and the bed is so comfortable. The terrace in the room is a plus and the toilet is pretty new. Nice experience!" .

Also staff could be more flexible with the check in time, the hotel was almost empty and we had to wait until 3pm to check in, after a long travel that would be a major plus. The bed was small for two people, but we didn't care that much and ti be fair it was specified in the booking upfront as a small double bed. - Outdated facilities, but clean and everything works. Quiet, private and cozy. Good dining options nearby. Good value for money." .

If you want a sterile hotel room with concierge and all the amenities, or if you need to be amid the noise and excitement of the bars and restaurants on the other side of the river, this is not the place for you. This is more like an American B&B (without the breakfast). It has shared bathrooms/shower on the first floor, which may be inconvenient for some. And as the hotel doesn't serve breakfast, it needs some planning to find something beyond coffee. - The location is perfect, and you are surrounded by major sites. And the atmosphere of the streets and the inn itself capture the spirit of old Kyoto. It's amazingly quiet, and you feel part of the neighborhood -- every night I stepped outside I'd pass the geishas-in-training walking to their appointments. I chose a Japanese style room, which was large and comfortable for one person, and provided the ideal setting for Kyoto. Rico the owner also helped make it a special experience, treating me on my first visit like I had been a regular customer for years. She has great recommendations for restaurants you may not find in your guidebook, and if you're willing she may even accompany you! This is a place with wonderful personal attention, making it an excellent choice for solo travelers and couples who truly want to feel what Kyoto is like. I came away refreshed, knowing I'd gone somewhere unique, and I can't wait to go back again!" .

Albeit a decent-sized room by Japan standards, there is no proper space/place planned for luggage and kettle and coffee-making. I have stayed in much smaller rooms in Japan that were much much well-planned in terms of space usage. Hangers were faced in an awkward direction - very user-unfriendly.

The room was very small (almost capsule-hotel-small) no place inside for more than 1 suitcase but there is a baggage room downstairs where you can keep your extra suitcase, small sink and mirror in the room as well as planty of hanging options and a useful shelf. All facilities were very clean, toilets (3 for women and 3 for men in each floor) and shared bathrooms which are all on the 1st floor but a short elevator ride away. There's a separate area right next to the showers with 6 \"stations\" in each a chair+sink+mirror+bright light+electricity outlet for make up or anything else. Breakfast was VERY basic (2 kinds of rolls, white bread, peanut butter, potato salad, hard-boild egg, miso soup, rice, coffe and tea) but free of charge... reception team was AMAZINGLY HELPFUL from the moment we stepped in the hostel and we would love to stay there again!!" .

We reached and kept ringing bell and knocking and no one responded. A lady came down cleaning after almost 20mins still not bothered about us. We had to catch hold of her. She could barely speak English so English speaking staff claim is not quite apt. She said our rooms will only be available later in the afternoon though we could see the rooms vacant. On requesting to leave our luggage their she charged us 1000Yen to just dump the luggage in corridor right there. On our return to property later in the evening we did not see anyone and the key was left in a basket at the counter for us. We were given room right at entrance though the ground floor which was empty when we got their but we were turned down for early check-in and charge to leave luggage. Also they had so many rooms empty further down the hall way but we got the room right on the street. We were disturbed by loud traffic till very late night and early morning. We did not see anyone the next morning when we checked out either. The room has stain of spilled coffee on the TV unit. So we paid money to go to a loud room and sleep on floor with no human interaction or food service which is an essential part of Ryokan experience. Such a rip-off and waste of money. - Nothing this stay was a total rip off." .

Both being vegetarian it was great having somewhere to cook our own food when we could not find anything to eat. Washing machine came in handy. Quiet at night and well located for transport. Fifteen minutes walk from Kyoto Station. Good location for sight seeing." .

It's conveniently located a short walk from the train station (around a 5 minute walk) and was really easy to find (the fact it's in Lonely Planet helps). The staff literally fall over themselves to help you; they are very knowledgeable about Kyoto and have lots of suggestions on temples to see and the transport you need to take to get to them as well as good recommendations on places to eat. They speak exceptionally good English (not sure about other languages) and couldn't be more friendly. Given we'd looked at other Ryokans that cost a lot more we really felt like we had a traditional experience that was exceptionally good value for money. If I'm ever back in Kyoto I'll be staying here again for sure, highly recommended." .

        hip:hasText  "I actually left this hostel after the first night even though I paid for two. It's a nice hostel but I think I had different expectations since I LOVED my stay at hostel wasabi Nagoya. The vibe was very different. I understand that since this hostel is in a residential area, they have different rules to follow. I wish I had read more about it and hope this review helps others. The main thing for me was that they lock the door at 1am. So if you go out at night with friends or other travellers, you need to be back by 1am or you are locked out. Also, although this hostels location is nice, I found it a bit far from the places my friends wanted to go out in. So I would have to leave at about 12 to get back to the hostel in time (oh and a 2000yen cab ride :( ) I also felt like whole vibe was to be completely silent, and that gives me anxiety. Some people really like that and I suggest booking here, but I felt really uncomfortable. I felt like I couldn't talk in the room or even in the common area. It's not a rule by them but like I said, it's kind of the whole vibe of the place. I feel like I have a lot of \"bad\" things to say but it really is a nice hostel, I just want to give my honest opinion so that other people like me don't come here and feel disappointed like I did. This place is made for some people but not for me. - I thought this hostel was very clean and a very nice building. Also the staff was very nice." .

They have shelves with items you can borrow (like travel adapters etc.). I also loved the bath house. Luxurious feel to soak in a hot tub after a long day of sightseeing. The fact that you don't have your own bathroom wasn't a problem at all. There is a nice sink with all kinds of toiletries in your room so you can do make up, hair and brush your teeth.

That is how small the room is. - The room was cleaned and fully equipped , from a large tv, a speaker, charger for every type of devices, and every other common basic needs of everyday life. Every corner was scrubbed and tidied up each morning. The staffs was friendly, eager to help even though their english was quite minimum. The hotel is right infront of the Kyoto Station, which made it easy and fast to travel around. Under Kyoto Station, there is a large food quarter, so finding restaurants wasn't a trouble. Many shoppings sreas were also nearby." .

Staff were very pleasant and helpful. The location is great for trains and buses (not so good for JR) and convenience stores. 100m away is the Shijo-Omiya station where you can catch a tram to see many shrines/temples and the monkey park in Arashiyama (definitely worth seeing)." .

What was odd was that they checked us in on the dot 2.00.00pm. It gave me the feeling they were just not flexible on letting us check in earlier. - The hotel was at the heart of Kyoto's shopping district and it made for key areas like Gion and nishiki to be walking distance of each other. It's near station such as Shijo or the Kurasume which made travelling to places like Arashiyama, Nara or Osaka extremely easy. Beds were clean and the shower was amazing, loved the jet spray." .

As an egg-lover, I know this wasn't made of egg. Also, for as long as I've been there, there had been hanging a black hair against the wall in the bathroom, next to the door. I'm a ginger. I let it stay there to see if the person who cleans it, would notice. He/she didn't. The toilet makes a flushing sound whenever you sit on it. Really annoying if you wake up in the middle of the night and like to pee quietly. It pretty much woke me up even more. During one night my neighbor was making a phone call in his room and I could understand every word he said. He wasn't trying to be quiet, but he also wasn't raising his voice. A note fixed that. But be aware that the walls might be a little tin. At least when you have a low voice ;) And last: the bureau was full with advertisement and papers. Considering how small the room is, it makes it really 'crowded'. - The matras was really good! I'm 5,4 inch (164 cm) with size 6 or 8 (34/36) and I would fit in it twice, and still sleep comfortable. You could fit in with two persons if you're not big and don't mind sharing personal space. The matras was hard enough, it was perfect. The view was perfect. It was very quiet (my room was on the 10th floor, like I asked). Though I might have lot of complaints - I do like the hotel. I slept like a baby, it was comfortable and quiet. That overrules every complaint I listed." .

Room is smaller compared to average hotel room, which I think is expected in Japan, however, all you need is available in the room - comfy sheets, clean shower and toilet, toiletries, nice shampoo, soap and conditioner and most importantly - no dusty and moldy smell. Everything we needed! Plus the onsen (first-timer here)! :) Plus the free drinks and supper (a bowl of good japanese rice and pickles) every night. It may not be much but my toddler loved it! It's a big deal for us since she is a bit of a picky eater especially when go out of country. Very near to Nishiki Market and around 20-30mins walk to Gion area. 10mins walk to Gion-Shijo and Kawaramachi station. There is also a nearby bus stop when going to Arashiyama area. Loved our stay here. Made our Kyoto vacation very pleasant. :)" .

The room was rather small, hard to get to suitcases and space narrow around beds. - A great variety of Japanese and Western food, hot was hot and cold was cold. Eggs were hot! Rolls lovely. Room was clean and well kept. Location was fabulous, across the street from the station, so making connections on busses and different train lines was a breeze. The price was great too. Air conditioning system was the quietest I have ever had anywhere." .

People smoking outside entrance of guest house is a little bit annoying for non-smokers. - Great place! Very affordable for Kyoto. Our double room (it was more like a suite) was huge and very comfortable compared to other rooms where we had stayed in Japan. Room was equipped with clean, private bathroom, kitchenette with basics (you can rent cooking utensils from front desk- one time fee for use during your stay), clean towels/sheets available if you want to change them. Good wifi, privacy of rooms, very quiet area. Close to buses (5 minute walk) and can buy the day-long bus pass from staff at guest house, staff is very helpful. Heater worked very well in the winter, we were warm." .

It should be noted, this is not a hotel, but rather an upmarket hostel. So, if you want a large hotel room with ensuite facilities that you can spend a long time in then this place is not for you. But, I liked the welcoming and friendly communal area downstairs, with free coffee and tea making facilities (leaf tea with teapots, grind your own coffee), lots of comfy seating, free clothes washing, Japanese communal baths (or more private shower cubicles if you prefer). It is just 5 minutes walk from Kyoto station - it would be a good location for Kyoto sightseeing. I stayed 4 nights, and would certainly re-book." .

But the size was not the problem. The bathroom door was GLASS and there was no lock! So there was no privacy and to make matters worse, there was a full size mirror on the opposite wall of the bathroom door and when you are in the toilet through the mirror even someone on the bed can see the toilet!!!!! So you can see into the toilet from all angels of the room. WHY? I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed this room. I was with my sibling and it was super uncomfortable so one of us had to leave the room while the other got ready. Even if i was with my husband I wold not have been comfortable. A glass door in such a tiny space is absurd! Also there was a kettle but nothing to make tea or coffee, not even a spoon in the room. For a 3 star hotel, thats not good. They also had a restaurant downstairs, but for lunch AND dinner the menu only had salad and pasta everyday!!!! - Hotel was modern, everything was clean, cleaning staff were super nice and so were the restaurant staff. bed was comfy and was a 6-7min walk to JR Nijo Station." .

When we arrived we had a small room (2 single beds), the windows was covered with privacy filament (couldn't see outside). when we addressed this the following morning, a young man at the front desk Kazuma Takada saved the day!! By the time we got back from our day of site seeing he had arranged for us to see 2 additional rooms which were much more acceptable and helped us move our luggage! His English was excellent and he continued to supply concierge services to us during our 1 week stay. He is a real asset to this hotel.

I understand this and I appreciate the eco aspect of not using fresh towels and sheets every day, but I also feel that a cleaned room is part of the rate and housekeeping is a low-skilled job that is important to preserve in a economy such as the Japanese, which is mostly needs highly skilled labor. Also, there was quite a large gap under the door, allowing the chatter from other guests in the hallways to be heard inside the room. Regardless, these are very minor issues, the hotel is very good value in Kyoto. - Hotel She, Kyoto was a very good selection for our stay in kyoto. The room had quite a good size, allowing us to open the two full size suitcases. The windows do open, and even though the hotel does not offer much of a view, being able to sleep with the window open without resorting to the AC was great. The hotel also offers \"handy\", a cellphone that you can just take with you and use unlimited data on. A terrific thing, I must say, we got tremendous use out of that.

Ryokan room was so clean and well equipped (slippers,toothbrush kit,yukata, tea ceremony box end etc.) It's a good place to get this japanese experience." .

Plus, during Gion Matsuri, you have the festival literally in front of the door. By the way, should you be looking for yukata, you need to go no further but across the road to Shinshoen (Nakagyō-ku, Kikusuibokochō, 567). Plenty of yukata in all sizes at decent prices. b) Ambiance and interior: Unizo really knows how to design their receptions, especially this one. The side entrance leads into a sideroad with wooden houses. Interior is simple, but (still) modern, particularly your bathroom. Speaking of that, the numbers of toiletries is impressive indeed. (Figures why half their hotel pictures feature them. ^.^) c) Staff: My mattress felt sat through and those fellas actually replaced it the next day. You don't get that from many hotels." .

It's alright, many other places practice this policy, but I so happened to be sick - not the most convenient! - Location, location, location! It is near the train station, near the shopping areas and is absolutely near Gion, and the river. :) Located on a very high floor and the view is amazing both in the day and at night. Didn't try the breakfast, so can't comment. Staff is great. The beds are super comfy." .

The hotel is located in the main shopping area of Kyoto, and is in the middle of couples of railyway/subway station, which means it takes about 5~10 mins to walk to any station. Fortunately, since it is located in the shopping strip, there is roof on the top of the streets leading to the stations, you can still get there easily even it rains. - The hotel is located in a shopping strip which made it convenient to shopping or grabbing some food even at the night. It's also quiet at night, as the main street is really noisy because of the vehicles and crowds. The staff are hospitality and helpful, also they provided complimentary bottle water everyday. There's an Ichiran Ramen opens 24h nearby and a 24h convenient store just at downstairs." .

There are public baths which are clean and we found it easier to take a shower here than in our shower in our room, as we felt a bit cramped. Possibly ok for the Japanese population, however for a Kiwi it is too confined, even my wife who is Japanese made a comment.

Hotel staff are very friendly and mostly English speaking. Great (but pricey) breakfast with a view of the inside the building garden." .

I use booking.com a lot and I've never seen 98% reserved! Overall I'm very happy with our stay here and would definitely book again. Our friends were staying in a hotel just down the road and were paying a lot more than we were! - We love that this place was two stops from Kyoto station on the subway. We had a JR pass, so paid the extra ¥210 each as we had luggage. I had emailed the hotel and they had told us to take exit 5 at Shijo, hotel is 1 minute on the left. We hired bikes from J Cycle who are just around the corner (thanks to the receptionist's advice) and we spent two days doing four of their suggested itineraries. We walk a lot, so were happy to use our feet to get to the restaurants we'd booked (if a restaurant takes reservations, I highly recommend during cherry blossom season!) The staff were friendly and gave out nice coffee when we asked for it from reception. We didn't go for the breakfast option, so can't comment there. Very happy with our hotel choice overall. The room was small as expected, but it was clean, had great water pressure, lots of included amenities and the staff were great." .

We stayed on a Western-Japanese style room with 2 single beds and 2 futons on a tatami area, which was spacious for us. Bathroom was new and clean. I'm not sure if the other types of rooms would be spacious though. They looked a little cramped (Japanese size after all) from the outside. But the location will make up for it. Staff were friendly. When we thought one of us might need to see a doctor, the staff who picked up my call brought a map showing the clinic location (5min walk) to my room immediately. When housekeeping forgot to give us a floormat for the bathroom and I called to request, it was brought to our room quickly, with lots of apologies. Even though the room was facing the street right in front of the train station, noise insulation was excellent. Couldn't hear any traffic." .

As elsewhere in Japan, the bathroom was great (good water pressure, lighting, towels and toilet) - no issues. And even the bed was decent (on the firm side, which seems to be standard in Japan). It is apartment style so no room cleaning during our stay, but keeps the costs reasonable. We arrived just after noon and were able to check in then, which was super.

The problem is that the hotel is trying to cater to both Western/Asian tastes (e.g. Scrambled Eggs and Sausages/Rice with toppings or vegetables), but neither options are great. Try it a few times, but you will most likely prefer to eat out for breakfast. Whether you In- or exclude the breakfast, the 1 person room could be considered a little bit expensive. - I stayed in an 1 person smoking room (I am a non-smoker though), and the room was quite nice. The common facilities were available in the room, and the air conditioning was great. However, the room is quite small though, it really is an 1 person room. Do not try to fit in luggage for 2 persons or more. The bathroom is also quite small. You are able to earn a free bottle of Water by being eco-friendly, which I consider to be a plus. The internet works fine for business purposes. The location is good. It is in the immediate area of Kyoto Station, 5 minutes walking. From Kyoto station you are able to reach all the business and touristic areas." .

We extended our budget to have what we thought would be a special treat. We did not expect to have an uncomfortable stay and then pay DOUBLE what was already an expensive price. I will NEVER stay somewhere like this again. The staff were lovely and I feel bad for them that they must have guests in shock on a regular basis when they go to pay. It was very embarrassing. DO NOT stay here if you do not LOVE eating fish or sitting/sleeping on uncomfortable furniture and paying about $800 Australian for a room per night (outrageous!!!). There is pretty much nothing else on the menu but fish. For this price, we could have paid our own chef to make anything we liked! But instead we were told that there were no changes to the menu... even if you were allergic to fish! No vegetable side dishes... really just fish. Even for breakfast. Very upsetting. I feel really disappointed at booking.com for not making the pricing of this venue more clear. We would have NEVER have stayed here if we knew the true price. I feel that the website was misleading. On top of this, the beds were uncomfortable and even painful, and there is nowhere comfortable to sit. I felt financially violated (as I have now read that another guest felt too). I cried. A lot. Don't make the same mistake. - N/A" .

This one was by far the worst value for money, it was the 2nd most expensive per night on our trip and certainly the one where you got the least. Although the room was very clean the wall paper was peaking off the wall in a number of places. Won't stay there again unless the price is a bit more realistic for what you get. - We booked this hotel as we wanted to experience a stay in a Japanese style room & not have to share a bathroom like other hotels.

This boutique hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood area and it is a bit of a maze getting around initially, but will get used to it by 2nd days. Saw 3 small temple around the hotel/motel vicinity. Nearest train station is Kiyomizu Gojo about 10 minutes walk from the hotel and just a short 1 stop ride to Gion Shijo areas where the night market and all the happening. Along the walk to Kiyomizu Gojo station, can also find FamilyMart, Lawson and 7 Eleven and several ramens and udon cafe." .

Other than this issues, everything in this place is perfect. - The interior very conceptual and i never see such a place like this. I thought the book is an old book actually the magazine very updated! This place also located very near from train and bus station, maybe about 100 meters and place in 9th floor which you can see Gion's landscape right after you wake up. So much in love with this place, next time I go to Japan I want to try either Tokyo or Fukuoka branch :)" .

        hip:hasText  "There were minimal storage facilities and we simply unpacked on to the window cill. The hotel meals were expensive and so we bought in our breakfast and snacks, easy because of the supermarket and French bakery only a few steps from the door. The empty and roomy fridge helped as well. A slightly irritating hotel policy is to request full payment on arrival, a procedure nevertheless clearly recorded on the website. - This hotel with its dark entrance is about a seven minute walk from the nearest metro station, but you have to change lines if coming from Kyoto Station - an extra complication if you have lots of luggage. A taxi cost us about £10. Our room had all the amenities one would expect, including a safe, toiletries, slippers, kimonos, and a Japanese-style mechanised loo. The hotel was extremely convenient, well-run, with friendly and helpful staff (although but we found the constant Japanese bowing a bit disconcerting until we got used to it). There are many medium range and upmarket eateries within a few minutes’ walk, and we particularly enjoyed the Indian restaurant round the corner, as a change from sushi and Japanese noodles. The location is excellent, within easy reach of many interesting sites as well as the maze of shopping malls. Sites worth visiting include the rather over-hyped Bamboo Grove (very crowded when we were there), many exotic temples and shrines, and a number of nearby delightful walks such as the bridge and riverside path just at the end of the street." .

We did arrive on Dec 31 so things may have been quiet, but this was not the case across the bridge or elsewhere in Kyoto when we explored that day. Subway and nearest convenience store is about 5-7minute walk. Room was clean, but very sparse. No natural light. Overall stay was OK, but what irked me about this place was if you arrive before the check-in time you have to pay an additional ¥1000 to get into the room - even if your room is clean and ready. That would make sense if we had requested an early check in, but we happened to catch an early train from Tokyo and showed up around 11am. We were told the room was ready, but couldn’t check in without paying extra. The other option is to just leave your bags at the front desk (for free) which was really helpful, but would’ve been nice to just go to the room. - The girl at the check-in desk on Dec 31 was incredibly helpful and informative. Her English was great and she gave us a very detailed intro to Kyoto and relevant guides and recommendations. Room was very clean with a big bathroom and good shower!" .

It didn't inconvenience me much, you just have to make sure you're up, showered, dressed and your pod is emptied of all your valuables by 10am, so consider setting your alarm. You can still leave your things in your locker and the luggage area of course. I would suggest to the hotel that they reduce the cleaning hours to 11am-3pm during times of lower occupancy. The staff spoke a little bit of English and I didn't have any problems communicating with them in English mixed with my limited Japanese, but I do think they could make guests feel more welcome than just bluntly asking me if I'm checking in, then going through the house rules. They always helped with everything I asked for, but didn't have enough enthusiasm or hospitality. It may be a budget capsule hotel but it should still be a welcoming and relaxing place to stay. It's nice that the hotel offers free fresh water, and at a cost, Coke, and hot or iced tea/coffee and mini hot dogs, but to advertise coffee and a mini hot dog as a 500 yen breakfast option is just weird, and I think the hotel should withdraw their claim that they offer breakfast. You're much better off going to the convenience store, where for less money you could get nice fresh sandwiches, cakes or pastries as well as hot and cold drinks - or if you want something better there is a French style bakery and restaurant which is a bit pricy but will serve coffee, sausages, bacon, eggs and toast, or a very nice riverside Starbucks, both a short walk away. Otherwise there is very little I can say negatively about this hotel, and if I was in Kyoto on a budget I would recommend it. - My favourite thing about this hotel was the lounge area in the reception. Beautifully decorated in a modern style inspired by traditional Japanese with bamboo, polished wood and paper lanterns, as was the rest of the hotel. It was a very pleasant place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. A marvellous 9th floor view over the city center and mountains. I paid a little extra for a sideways pod which means less pods in the room and a more spacious feel. I think this was worth it, although the occupancy was very low in my room anyway. If it was busy I'm sure things would have felt different. For a capsule hotel, the bed was actually quite good since it had a real mattress. A shallow one, but still, a mattress. As a result, the sleep quality was about on par with a budget business hotel. The rooms and shower facilities were spotlessly clean and quiet. You had a small changing area behind a locked door before entering each shower cubicle, so you have complete privacy. You have shampoo, conditioner, body soap and towels all provided and the hotel offer extras like toothbrush, shaving razors etc. Anything else you need can be bought from one of several convenience stores a stone's throw away. They have coin laundry facilities with a dryer too. There's a choice of slightly expensive but very nice restaurants in the same building that you can just jump in the elevator to, except the Italian one. I pressed the basement floor button and the door opened to reveal a busy kitchen blocked off by tall trolleys. Awkward! Just go to the first floor and walk out and downstairs to get there. The location is pretty good. Plenty of affordable food options and convenience stores within walking distance. It's a 5 minute walk from Sanjo station on Kyoto's underground metro, and about a 15 minute walk from lots of souvenir shopping and Gion's Hanamikoji street which is where you could spot a geisha or maiko if you're lucky..." .

There is shampoo and body wash that is provided which smells amazing. You also get free breakfast as a guest at the hostel. It is only toast and juice, but it's something.

Also, the front staff misplaced our key a few times during our stay. It was politely suggested that we may have forgotten to drop it off and they were always nice about it, and apologized profusely when it turned up, but it did dampen our experience a bit, being lead to think that perhaps it *was* us. - The property is beautifully designed Service/staff was close to excellent Very easy access to subway" .

I thank the hotel staff for allowing us staying in double beds room without additional fee (I booked room with twin bed and changed my mind when checking in). I like the bed. It is the most comfy bed of the hotels we stayed in during the trip. The breakfast seems also delicious. It is a bit regret that we did not reserve for the breakfast. Because I like the Higashiyama area very much, staying in this hotel becomes perfect option. It is located few steps from Gion district, 10 minutes walk (according to my standard) to Kamo river (do not forget to bring along the coffee you bought in the hotel's Starbucks and good book!), near Naritaya halal restaurant, Yasaka shrine and many more." .

Staff were attentive, friendly, and not afraid to have a bit of banter. The room was surprisingly large given the location for relatively cheap price. The best hotel of my trip which consisted of 6 or 7 hotels. Didn't get round to using the complementary indoor public baths so cannot comment but I assume these were awesome if the rest of the hotel is anything to go by. Recommended." .

It was cheap and spacious compared to the size of our hotels in Tokyo. The rooms are very basic, but we felt it had everything we needed--even a small kitchenette. If you stay here, you have to find a bar called (something) 'Enoteca'; it's a make-shift Italian tapas bar right around the corner. It is an amazingly cozy and quaint bar, with great wine and amazing ambience! We stumbled across it when we got a little lost walking home one night and we're so happy we did. It was our favorite bar in Tokyo and Kyoto combined. He even let us put on our own music. Just go! :) This place is close to the bus stop and a Mcdonalds.

The sitting area on the ground floor is supposedly part of the hotel restaurant which closes at 11 pm. Having spent 6 nights there, I was disappointed by the fact that guests were expected to clear the lounge area by 11 pm (like school children being sent off to bed). Besides that, I was also told off by one of the restaurant waiters (pretty rudely) for snacking on peanuts at the lounge even though there was no sign stating that outside food or drinks were not allowed. The welcome drink does add a nice touch as it was nice to come back to a mug of hot sake on a windy night, but service of bar staff and waiters are less than ideal. Definitely not up to the level of service I've experienced in Osaka and Tokyo for sure. Much to improve. - Walking distance from Kyoto Station, quite a central location as most sights (except maybe Arashiyama, Ryōan-ji Temple) are a good 10-40 minutes travel by train (and even lesser by car) depending on which direction. Helpful English speaking reception staff. Hotel breakfast had a good variety and was pretty decent." .

The closest JR station is Kyoto Station, which is a 34 or so minutes walk. - The incredible breakfast! It changed each day. There were different kinds of breads and different toppings for rice. They even wrapped some breads for those who need to check-out early. The kitchen was amazing and easy to use. They utilized an honest system where people wash their own dishes after using them. For New Year's, they even had a free event where people participated to make takoyaki and write some kanjis for the next year. The beds were comfortable and the private bathrooms were clean and extremely nice. (I didn't check the public ones.)" .

If you arent used to a capsule, the rules about handing your key in when you leave, having to wear pajamas inside room and to public bath, or being woken by others in room at night might be a surprise. But if you know what to expect with a capsule, this is a good one, and a good option for budget trip to Kyoto. - Great location. Comfortable beds. Quick check in and check out. Breakfast was sufficient. Relaxing bath area." .

Bed has noise when u move and so I'm not dare to move at all in order to avoid waking up my partner. Staff not really helpful and most of their staff don't really know English. I was expecting staff in such a big hotel group and working in such a popular place would have better English. - Good location as its near the Kyoto station" .

It's a bit of a walk from Kyoto Station, especially if you leave though the central ticket gates. - Close to a mall with lots of shopping and restaurants. Staff was really friendly. Bus stop for buses that will take you to most major tourist spots is right outside the hotel. It was a good, cheap business hotel in central Kyoto, so it did the job for us just fine!" .

Whilst not the most substantial or 'healthy' breakfast, it did the job of giving a bit of sustenance before beginning our day of sightseeing. Vegans and those on a gluten-free diet will have to make other arrangements, but there were a few other places to grab a more substantial breakfast nearby. The breakfast room was woefully inadequate to accommodate the number of hungry guests who were hoping to grab a bite before leaving for the day, but it was easy enough to take some pastries and coffee/tea back to your room as the fare on offer didn't require many utensils or table and chairs to enjoy.

This made it cumbersome to go for baths/ meals - especially if you're having dinner and breakfast with them. At the baths, other bathers staying in the main building would come and go in their yukatas while we had to dress in our \"regular clothes\" and bring towels from our room. We felt we didn't have the true ryokan experience and were a bit disappointed. Compared to the other ryokans we saw, this was one of the most centrally located and cheapest options, but considering the price we paid for just one night, they could've included breakfast too - even a simpler one than the paid option would be good. Check-in is late at 3pm and check-out is 10am, which we found was a bit of a pity. It wasn't a surprise to see people smoking in the ryokan lobby as we have read about places allowing it, but it was still off-putting to have the cigarette smell lingering indoors and on your clothes. Wifi was the Kyoto free wifi and truthfully was a bit sad. I couldn't connect to it for some reason and found this rather inconvenient. I wouldn't recommend staying in their annex but perhaps would have a better experience than we did if you were in one of the rooms in the main building. - Staff were extremely friendly and helpful albeit the language barrier can be a bit difficult to overcome. Some other reviewers mentioned it to be a problem but we have to be aware English is not their first language and acknowledge their effort to try and explain things in English. Location is central but quiet and overlooking the river with many restaurants nearby. The futons were thick and comfy and the blankets were oh-so-toasty warm. Their shampoo/conditioner/body wash were surprisingly good and moisturising and we wished we could buy some home! We haven't been to many public baths (just 2), but we went at nighttime and there were only 2 other ladies besides us. Good for us shy and insecure gaijin who aren't used to seeing naked bodies in the same bath as us." .

On the other hand, there are lots of areas within walking distance. The key system was new to me--every time you left the building you turned in your key to the front desk. Not at all a problem, but I could imagine that it would make some people uncomfortable having to interact with the desk every time their coming in or out. The upside is you'll always have access to the room even if your group splits up, since the first one back gets the key from the desk and can let the rest of the group in. - An older hotel, with older style of amenities, but not bad. For example, the doors had manual locks, and the decorating in general was a bit old-fashioned. The bathrooms were quite large--both a shower and a bath, with a separate door from the toilet area." .

The hotel is not far away from the station (10 minutes walk), you even don't need to take a taxi. It might be important if you travel by train to Nara or Osaka during your staying in Kyoto or if you need to find a good place for eating. At the station we found restaurants with the best food (Japanese and western style) with a descent price. The Kanra Hotel is next to a buddhist temple - one of the most beautiful we've seen during our trip in Japan." .

Also, This is a family owned Ryokan BTW, which is basically a small house that has 3 small apartments on the 2nd floor. So, they need you to be quiet after 10 PM, especially considering the fact that the whole house is made of wood. (This one is just a fact, not necessarily a disadvantage). - A new experience and a good value of money, and a good location. Not far away from the Kyoto's main metro station. The staff were kind to offer us hot beverages, and a free photo of us before we left." .

However, breakfast serving time was extremely annoying and inconvenient (6:30am to 9:30am). We have travelled all around the world and it was the first time we have seen such an inconvenience timing. The hotel management must understand that a hotel is supposed to serve it guests not torture them. Most hotels around the world serve breakfast till 10:45 am. 2- Breakfast was the same every day with very limited options to choose and although we were there at 8:45 am most of dishes were swept out by the other guests. Shockingly, they did not refill the dishes after 8:30 am. We did not enjoyed the breakfast at all in spite of the fact that we paid for it, we began skipping it after the forth day of our stay. What kind of hotel does not serve a bread with the breakfast? What kind of hotel does not serve lunch? What kind of hotel does not serve dinner except few limited options E.G. Pizzas? Really?!! 3- We paid to get a bigger room and big bed but bed was next to the wall (who sticks the bed to the wall) so my husband had to jump over me at night times in order to get off the bed. I nearly broke his nose one time when he was trying to get into bed at midnight. 4- ac did not work properly and it was not comfortable inside our room considering the outside temperature was 41 degrees. 5- Regarding the public bath, unfortunately we did not use it at all because you have to be completely naked to get into the bath. Not every one is interested to show their private parts to complete strangers. You might need to consider the fact that most western people like to wear swimming suits for million different reasons. 6- There is nowhere around the world that you see people serve alcohol to under 18 at the bar. - 1- They let us check in one hour earlier (at 1pm instead of 2 pm). In addition, we have received one complimentary sparkling drink in our room. After a very long flight it was a nice touch. 2- Live music at the lobby was fun and it was completed with one drink at the bar every night. 3-Cleaning service was great." .

        hip:hasText  "Kyoto is expensive, so boutique hotels / ryokans are really pricey, and many budget ryokans I looked at had reviews like \"thin walls\" \"shared toilet\" \"curfew\" which this didn't have. Still, as a midrange option it was still at the top of my budget and I really don't think worth the money at all. I didn't feel like I had the ryokan experience - the room is nice and traditional but the rest of the hotel is very dated (on the wrong side of vintage) and tatty in parts. Also unlike other ryokans, we (3 white guys) were the only guests to wear our Japanese robes down to breakfast which was kind of embarrassing! They were also playing awful, loud pop music (coming from a pop music fan). It is in a nice location, close to pontocho alley on a lovely street, but the river view was not very nice. Perhaps this is totally different in spring/summer with trees and flowers, but in winter the river is quite unattractive, and the trees are bare so you're just looking out onto a busy road across the river. Not very relaxing! The shared baths are nice (they are public but we used them twice and were alone) - particularly the bigger one on the 5th floor, the one on the 7th floor was just ok, but there is no view from either as the windows are frosted over (which given my above statement was ok I suppose). Also the floor mattresses were thin - thankfully there were spares in the cupboard so we all used two. Overall my main complaint is the price, none of these things would have been an issue in a cheaper hotel, but at that price they were disappointing and I wish I'd just stayed in another budget place. - Inside the room was nice, traditional style. Food at breakfast was good, though the overall breakfast experience was standard hotel, not traditional ryokan. Having the hot baths is a nice feature (this was one of the main reasons I booked). Hotel is on a lovely street." .

This hotel is perfect for a 2-3 nights stay but might be a bit a bit stifling for a longer stay. - The biggest asset of this hotel is the very central location, just in front of the Kyoto station. This means that coming from Osaka Kansai airport is very easy as you just need to take the Haruka train and you are at hotel. The staff was very nice and breakfast was diversified. It is an Ibis which means pretty standard service and no bad surprise upon arrival. I recommend the Isetan food floor at the station as they have massive assortments of fresh food including sushis etc at very reasonable price." .

No welcome smile, no warm greetings when check-in. The entré had a strong smell of cleaning liquid or some kind of air freshener. It was annoying to breath this in while going in and out from the hotel. Room was too small which made it too warm. AC was above the bed, so it was quite hard to have it on during the night. WC door was made of transparent glass, it was not silencing at all and the person who was laying in the bed could see and hear all action in toilettes. I founded it odd. - The room was very clean, beautiful and with a modern style. Beds were quite comfy. Shower was wonderful with different settings such as tropical rain etc. We had an incredible restaurant experience near by the hotel. The name of place is Adachi. The restaurant lady was was very sweet and helpful. She served authentic Japanese food which tasted fantastic and was surprisingly cheap. It was practical to have subway and big provision shop so close by." .

He didn't even get a bottle of water in the room and we were told we had to share our breakfast with him as he would not be getting any - does that seem right when we were paying over £600 per night for a family of four?? When I complained at reception, the member of staff changed from being bright and helpful to being sullen, unhelpful and sulky and remained so until I strategically decided to tell him it wasn't his fault to minimise the effect on our stay, but he was still cool towards me throughout our stay. Otherwise, at that price it is only right to expect perfection, but when we arrived the kids were given a small toy - nice gesture but the toys were so cheap and of such poor quality that they both ended up broken and had to be put in the bin within minutes. We also found a broken glass on the table in the room, which clearly hadn't been checked prior to our arrival. The lift also broke down on three occasions during our stay. We stayed in another ryokan on this stay and the comparison with the comfort of the futons was stark - at the Matsui-Bekkan Hanakanzashi my wife and I both struggled to sleep, whereas in the other ryokan I can honestly say that the futons were more comfortable than a western-style bed. Furthermore, we had requested a quiet room, but were put at the front of the building overlooking the road, which was occasionally noisy, particularly early in the morning (deliveries perhaps?) The room also did not appear to have been cleaned during our three-night stay. Overall, I would say that this ryokan would have been worth around 30% of the price we were charged, so definitely look elsewhere unless they have slashed their prices! - Location The on-site onsen" .

Two places to serve breakfast: one is buffet type with a large variety of choices; the second - Japanese set breakfast(keep in mind they don't seem to serve cappuccino there, though one floor down - at the buffet area - they have several coffee machines) You had a coffee machine in the room too. And the shower area includes the shower and the bathtub in the same space.(the kind of shower space you see in Japanese houses photos)" .

Really close to the main station, which is really convenient. The price was also great - I didn't expect the hotel to be that nice. The room wasn't really big, but it was enough for one person. It was clean and the bed was very spacious and comfy. The breakfast was rather limited (toasts, eggs, jam, honey, butter, coffee), but it was included in the price, so better than nothing.

It comes in 2 minutes to take from the lobby. You ask for restaurant? The con cierge tells you exactly where to go and makes reservations. And the room wad perfect. I disagree with some reviews that state that the separate toilet is awkward. For us it was perfect. Hope to come back to Kyoto and stay here again." .

It's a minor complaint, but noticeable. My boyfriend couldn't get used to the futons, so he had trouble sleeping, but if you're okay with very firm mattresses then you won't have a problem. - Very large rooms, super clean, extremely helpful staff. Pay extra for at least one morning with a traditional Japanese breakfast, the room its served in is really pretty and the meal is a fulfilling way to start a day of being a tourist. You're literally right in the middle of a lot of cute shops/restaurants/cafes and not a far walk from Kyoto's main shopping district." .

Being able to cook a simple breakfast with my partner in the morning was pretty nice and reduced cost. You can rent cooking utensils from the front desk for 500 yen 5 dollars) and buy supplies from the multiple convenience stores in the area. Definitely improved our stay to have control over our breakfast." .

The beds are ridiculously comfortable (soft mattress, different pillows to choose from), everything is clean, curtain allows for some private time. Common space is really big, has everything you need and looks luxurious. First night I got there the staff organised Takoyaki night (you could try to make takoyaki for 100 yen) - excellent idea. And there is even a cafe in the basement (with complimentary coupon for beer/coffee). I've rented a bike there, great way to explore the city and very easy too. Staff was always incredibly nice, helpful and accommodating. I mean, that hostel spoiled me. I don't know if I will ever stay anywhere this great again (for that price)." .

Sleeping area is one of a kind, you feel like you are resting inside a very futuristic sleeping pod. The capsule offers an alarm system that controls the \"lighting\", it dims when it is time to sleep and turns bright when you need to wake up. It works for me as it is a good alternative to traditional alarm clocks especially if you are staying with a group of people.

Location: need 15 min of subway and 15 min walk to arrive at this hotel with its street´s name written only in Japanese. It was a trouble to found it. 5. Having booked \"Japanese Superior Room\" we have been asked to prepare our own beds -japanese futton- with the linen. One of the linen had 2 HOLES!! 6. We were also asked to connect the fridge if we would intend to use it!! 7. We are also asked to water refill and connect the humidifier if we would use it! 8. For this true shame as ahotel, we payed the unbelievable quantity of 60.000 Yens (600 US dollars) for ONE night without breakfast. The worst relation price/facilities we had never experienced in our numerous trips around the world and 10 different hotels through Japan. That was the reason of the cancellation of the other 3 nights we had previously booked. We will never come back there. We do not reccomend to any people to book this hotel. Ours was a very bad experience. - Friendly staff" .

It wasn't fancy, but it wasn't too basic either. It was sweet and simple, clean and comfortable, with modern decor and amenities. The room was small, which was perfectly fine as this is what we expected (and have come to get used to) in Japan. The location was great (a short walk to subway lines, great restaurants all around, a convenience store next door, a supermarket across the road and the main shopping district a 20 minute walk away). There was a coin laundry within the hotel (an added bonus!) The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming. There was a minor issue with the toilet that we mentioned offhand (one of the bidet functions didn't work) and they booked a repair in almost immediately. The value for money, together with the location, the great staff and comfortable facilities, means I would happily stay here again on my next trip to Kyoto." .

The free coffee and tea in the lobby is great, especially because you don't have much space in the room if you want to relax after a long sightseeing day. You can choose one of the 3 breakfast options (beef stew) with rice and miso instead of the bread bun and that makes it much better and a bit more Japanese. The shower is on the lobby floor just before the entrance to their common baths. It's very clean and big. It just feels more sustainable to have the common lounge and shower areas, and if you're really shy about being naked in front of same sex people you could maybe change inside the shower cabin because you have a towel rack where you can leave stuff for keeping it dry. You do have a sink in the room and the common toilets on the floor." .

The 3D effects created by the dark wooden planks against the golden-beige walls makes us feel as if we were in a peaceful wood forest. Executive Floor Room was comfortable, and spacious. Japanese style sliding doors and the tea-set are of Kyoto-style. The room view was amazing with peaceful mountain ranges as the backdrop. The complimentary shuttle bus service between Righa Royal and JR Kyoto was very convenient. The frequency was excellent as general waiting time is 5min ~ 10min" .

Can be a bit depressing if staying for more than a couple of nights. They make the bed every two days. And there is no water kettle in the room.. - The location is great. 10 minutes walk from the hachijo exit of Kyoto Station. There are bus routes to most major tourists sites within 15 minutes walk. And loads of good food choices nearby. The room is small but functional. The bathroom is very clean and I enjoyed the bathtub a lot. They provide basic complimentary breakfast." .

It would be a great addition to install additional lighting directly over the mirrors as well as in the entry foyer. (2) The exhaust fan in the bathroom shower/tub area was rather loud, and ran 24/7. Because it was not controlled by a switch, staff came and applied a towel over the fan plate our very first nite which definitely dulled the sound. With all interior bathroom doors closed, noise was greatly reduced. Did not interfere with sleep after towel-adjustment made. These two issues did not in any way impact the overall excellent quality of comfort we experienced! But since you asked ... - This property can make a run for five stars! The furnishings are luxurious from the lobby through the floor hallways into the rooms. We stayed in the four-bed luxury family room which was absolutely wonderful! There was plenty of room for everyone to move about, and the sitting area was a great divider of space. The bathroom was very upscale, and having two separate bathing areas was a real plus. (There was one separate shower stall, and another shower room with tub and separate shower head. The commode was yet another separate room w/sink.) It was like a mini-apartment which was a real treat after spending two weeks in other parts of Japan in rather compact rooms. Also, the buffet breakfast is unbelievable with EVERY possible item you could desire. They offer both a full Japanese as well as western style breakfast buffets. Will definitely return to RIHGA if in Kyoto again!" .

        hip:hasText  "As others have said, the cleaning is not very good and the rooms have seen better days but all in all Ohto ryokan is good value for money at a great location. One HUGE problem is the landlady leaves all the doors to all the rooms wide open for several hours in the middle of day as she goes about cleaning the house from floor to floor. (It appears that she is alone on deck, and attempts to do all the jobs of running a busy hotel herself...perhaps this is why the cleaning and other types of maintenance suffers considerably...) So, all the doors to the rooms wide open, and elderly lady alone in the house who potters about randomly, doing a bit here, a bit there... on top of the front door always being unlocked 24/7, too, basically means anyone can wander into the ryokan, and into your room for several hours uninterrupted and help themselves to anything they want. Now, I understand that Japanese people are very trusting and crime and theft is low in Kyoto, but the same can not be said for the rest of the world, and in a house full of random strangers you just never know. It was quite a shock to come home and find the door to my room wide open and my computer, valuables and personal belongings on free display on the table etc. Even when I asked her to always lock my room after cleaning, and she agreed to, she did the same the very next day. That was quite a stressful element to an otherwise pleasant trip, and an otherwise friendly landlady who tried her best to be helpful. It really is a very big minus indeed that you don't know if your stuff will be there when you get back - On the plus side it's a huge relief to find that it is all still there! My best guess is that she simply can't understand that there are people in the world that steal when opportunity presents itself. - Inexpensive stay at a great and convenient location very close to the main train station, a subway station, the national museum, some of the major temples and several cafes, restaurants and convenience stores. It is also a friendly and pleasant neighborhood. The bedding was comfortable." .

We went first into this wrong place. You can find this hotel leaving Kyoto station at the main exit, facing to Kyoto Tower, than turn left and go till you can see a pedestrian bridge over the road (cca. 500 m). The hotel is on the north side of the street after the Makita hardware store, and does not look like hotel, more like a restaurant. On the left side on the wall next to the entrance there is a small English sign with the hotel name, but on the fassade there are only Japanese letters. The rooms are brand new, really only for one person, but for one person is perfect. We got two neighbouring rooms with my wife. If you put down one luggage, no place remains for the second one. They do not advertise the breakfast, this is complimentary, and enough for the beginning of the day (you got even onion soup). At the checking-in you can pay with credit card." .

While the option to choose two freebies (tea, shower gel, bath salts etc..) was a nice gesture, it made the hotel stay feel cheap. - To be honest, I had little expectations for this business hotel. The front desk was dull, and it did not provide a luxe ambience despite the mid-tier pricing. However, I have found that the features of the room allowed you to customise to your individual needs (ie. the lamp is adjustable – brightness/white or orange light) and also whether you needed hot/cool air in the bathroom. This extra touch was a bonus. Also the bed in the superior single room was so comfortable and spacious. I also enjoyed the friendly service of the cleaning staff, I have opted for the eco-clean up and she made sure to provide all the amenities I needed everyday. Another commendable note to the hotel staff - I left my charger in the room during check-out and sent an urgent email for the charger to be mailed to Tokyo. The replies were prompt and action was quick, I managed to retrieve it without hassle all thanks to Mr Miyagawa's assistance. Location of the hotel was great too! So close to two metro stations and it is so easy to locate. I look forward to coming back here. :)" .

You can access the underground passageway to Shijo Station (Subway), Karasuma Station, & Kawaramachi Station (Hankyu Line) just outside the hotel along Shijo Street. Finding the building along Shijo was no problem. As for the entrance, it's just around the corner on Fuyacho Street, where you can see a Matsumoto Kiyoshi drugstore. Just a few steps along Shijo and you're already at Teramachi, Shinkyogoku, and Nishiki Market! If you walk a little more along Shijo past Kawaramachi, you'll be able to see Pontocho just before the bridge over Kamo River. Nearby department stores to name a few are Marui OIOI, Fujii Daimaru, Daimaru, and Takashimaya. There's also a really nice(!) public bath, coin laundry, and a vending machine on the 3rd floor. The public bath is open until 1AM every night. The room keys used here is a card key, so unlike other hotels, there is no need to leave your key at the front desk before stepping out. Breakfast is on the more expensive side, but there are lots of cafes outside the property that open as early as 7:30AM, especially along Shijo, Teramachi, Shinkyogoku, and Kawaramachi. The room is a little compact, but that is expected of properties in Japan, so no problems. I still had enough floor space to pack my large luggage." .

The hotels at Karamachi or Gion are too convenient to be my cup of tea. I need a “buffer” and that makes Unizo a good choice. Apart from the location, it is good value for money and easy to book. I had a quiet room on the top floor and a comfy bed, giving me restful sleep. The bath room was better than that of hotels of same band. What a coincidence! It was the room I stayed in June last year. And I still enjoyed passing by or taking a break at the lobby very much this time. I like the dry rock garden and the two entrances which are very clever design. In fact, Japanese garden was the very reason for my two visits to Kyoto. The staff at the front desk were polite, patient and helpful. I had no more room for photos on my mobile phone. I approached the front desk for advice on where to buy a memory stick. Thank you so much, Mr XXX. I got one at Big Camera near Kyoto Station. He offered me help on another occasion. An eatery餃子王將 which is 15 minute walk from the hotel charged me 3 items instead of 4 by mistake. I knew it the moment I read the bill. But I cannot speak Japanese at all. So when I returned to the hotel, I asked him to write me a few words in Japanese. With what he wrote I went to the eatery to explain what happened. Well, maybe proficiency in the language of a neighbouring Asian country is more important to the hotels in Kyoto these days. There may not be staff speaking very good English at all times. But you will be fine. The Japanese always do the best they can. As with dining, you will be spoilt for choice when you stay at Unizo. Don’t just spend time shopping at Karamachi and Gion unless you are an absolute die-hard shopaholic. Take a bit of time to explore the streets and alleys around and opposite to the hotel during your stay." .

That could be easily corrected with a low cost investment. WIndows are translucent, you cannot see through ; being claustrophobic I had to open the window to see the street and buildings outside. Fortunately there is a net to prevent the intrusion of insects in the room. The checkin time is late, and the hotel does not offer the possibility of an advanced checkin which is a problem when you arrive in the morning ; that was my case after a flight of 12hours from Paris. I solved the problem by booking a supplementary night preceding my arrival in order to be allowed to access immediately to my room. - Amiable staff : they accepted to change my room for another one with a larger outside view (see the negative comments). The hotel was quiet, very clean and comfortable. The common kitchen and dining room nearby the front desk is very convenient, as well as the washing machines and the dryers. Excellent WiFi, a small refrigerator and a boiler is all you need for a short business stay of one week. Small bathroom as usual in this category of japanese hotel but everything was running well. Kujo subway station is not far from the hotel (200 to 300m) but you can reach the southern gates of Kyoto Central Station by walking about 12 minutes." .

There are not many restaurants around though its a hot tourism place. Many dessert and souvenir shops. We dont eat sweet things, therefore, it was hard for us. We end up buying a lot from Lawson. 3. The room is a little bit too dry, if they could add a simple humidifier would be better. - The location of the hotel is prefect though u need to take bus for around 5 stops, but it only takes 2 mins walk from bus station to hotel. The staff speaks good English and very friendly. The room is big enough and with a nice balcony face to internal, you could move the dining chairs and table outside to enjoy the sunshine. Though the hotel located next to the high way, but it is very quite at night. The facilities at room are very convenient, everything instructed very clear. We used the microwave for breakfast everyday, and did laundry 2 times. The bathroom could dry the cloth over night (super!). We did not borrow the kitchen tools as we could ask supermarket around to provide us chopsticks and spoon. Need to be careful to deal with trash as the hotel request to separate them. I read many people complained about the no supermarket around, but actually, there are 2 Lawson around: one is on the way to Kiyomizu temple, another one was located on another side of the high way ( around 7 mins walk), there are also 2 supermarket (7-11) and Lawson special (they sell fresh vegetable) located on the right side of the hotel (go out and turn right and keep walk around 10 mins). Definitely will introduce to friends." .

There wasn't a bar, just a cafe, although beer could be purchased from a vending machine on the 4th floor. There wasn't a communal area to sit and relax in. The breakfast was very limited. For the international breakfast, there was a choice of eggs, ham or streaky bacon (2 rashers), a bowl of salad, a small portion of fruit and a choice of milk or yoghurt. There wasn't a buffet. There were very few restaurants close to the hotel and it was a 10 minute walk to the nearest station. - The hotel was very clean. It was easy to hail a taxi outside the hotel, but we had to ask for a business card for the hotel to show the taxi drivers when returning. Many didn't know where it was. It was opposite the Imperial Palace gardens, which was lovely to stroll through, although it is more of a park than a garden." .

The bathroom sinks are downstairs by the reception desk, and it just feels weird to brush your teeth as the guesthouse owner is cooking breakfast or hanging out behind the desk. Even worse, one of the bathrooms — though a private bathroom with a sliding door — is like 1 foot away from the reception desk, and directly across from it. It's a little uncomfortable, but Tommy (the guesthouse owner) is cool. - I couldn't recommend a better place to stay in Kyoto. This is a traditional looking Japanese house in a gorgeous neighborhood with cute corner coffee shops and alike. It's easy to get around Kyoto but is still tucked away in a quaint neighborhood. The guesthouse owner who lives there (a nice Japanese man named Tommy) is just the absolute best. I have never met someone who cares more about you having a great time in Japan. He's an amazing resource. The beds were floor beds, but extremely comfortable. We had great A/C, cool colorful lights and tatami mats in our room. Everything was done artfully. He also offers to cook you breakfast (we didn't stay to try it), but honestly, there's no better experience than this." .

For budget concern, I did not stay all the eight nights at The Gallery. I just booked a room at The Gallery for one night and eventually stayed on for one more night. No regret that I did knowing very well that it was too late to have refund on the room I had reserved at another hotel. HOTEL POLICY: Fully in support of the policy of adults only and NOT admitting tour groups, not even a mini private group of friends and family. ROOM & BALCONY: It is a city hotel, not a beach resort or a mountain villa. Very unusual to have a balcony. Some say it is queer or useless in their reviews. I wouldn’t say so. Picture it in your mind that there is the full moon above you or it is a starry night. Even without the moon or stars, the balcony offers you a good look at the neighbourhood. I did spend a moment or two in the balcony in the three days. And I experienced no disturbance from other hotel guests or the passing pedestrians on the public lanes down below. I checked in on 19 December. It wasn’t very cold. Sometimes I would switch off the air-conditioner and opened the sliding partition to get fresh air and to save energy. As with the room itself, it was spacious, bright and clean. The bed was comfortable and there was no problem with the pillow. I like the thermograph and the phone. PUBLIC SPACE & VIBE: As attractive as they appear to be on the website. RESTAURANT: It was my fourth trip to Kyoto. I usually have quick meals to save time for sight-seeing. The Gallery made me break my rule. I thoroughly enjoyed the two breakfasts and two dinners at the on-site restaurant. The live music was a real bonus. The guitar still rings in my ears. Note that the restaurant is not open to outsiders. STAFF: They spoke good English, not to mention that they were helpful and friendly. On my departure day, someone came out from the main block to volunteer to be my photographer. I never asked." .

Unfortunately the days we were there the person who conducted the tea ceremony had their 'day off' and refused to come in especially for us (even though we had enough people to book out the ceremony). Additionally you can only use the baths in the evening which wasn't made clear enough to us on check-in. So the only time we could use it, they would not let us use it. Was a little disappointing because as we did not use the added amenities or the top room in our loft, it was a bit of waste of money booking that room. - The staff were lovely! Good recommendations of things to do, eat and see. Also our welcome was so nice, they really spent time going through everything and explaining how to make our beds etc. Very hospitable We had the loft room, it was more spacious than other rooms but unfortunately we didn't utilise it too much as there was too much to see in Kyoto. But it would have been nice to relax upstairs with a cup of tea. I really enjoyed making and packing up our beds each night/morning. But they did offer to have it made up if we needed. Also the space downstairs was great to relax in, we were travelling in a group of 11 and they were happy for us to buy some drinks at the family mart and drink them in the bar." .

It is very easy to find from the station, and from there, a quick walk to either Gion or Kiyomizudera, or back to Kyoto station to catch any train or bus you need. The room we stayed in was huge! We chose a Japanese style room when we booked, and the futons were so, SO comfortable. The walls were thick, so we never heard other guests during our stay, and the shower/private soaking tub with our room was PERFECT after a long day of sightseeing. And the state of the art toilet is in a separate, private area from the shower, which is great when you're traveling with a group--it saves so much time. And there was a little kitchenette with stove, mini-fridge, and electric kettle, too. Everything was brand new and the room design was tasteful and lovely. On top of all that, the staff was informative, kind, welcoming, and went above and beyond to be helpful. (One of our suitcases broke during travel, and they assisted us in ordering new ones from Japanese Amazon, receiving the shipment, and delivering the new suitcases to our room.) They were warm, friendly, caring...and all for an incredible price! I hope to come to Kyoto again so that I can stay here once more!" .

At one point our phones in the hotel room stopped working and they had a tech on it with about 10 mins or less then that who just swapped the phones out and it was great after that! The only thing is that because hot air dose rise and we all know that it is hot on the top levels of the hotel when you exit your room and the elevator but once in your room it's amazing! And when your in the lobby it's beautiful! - I liked everything at the hotel, the beds were comfortable, the hotel staff were friendly and took their time to find me things I was actually interested in that they didn't actually know about and they left me little messages to come and see them when they found out about what I was looking for, there was heaps of information about Shinto shrines near by and how we could get to them, plus heaps of other places, on arrival we were given a up to date visitors giude which I really liked! Everything about the hotel just was so smooth!" .

The sauna and spa facilities are really good. Location is excellent - right in the middle of a series of machiyo-style shops, and within walking distance of the town centre and the main temple district." .

For one person I believe the room would have been very good.The window had a view of the neighboring wall, which is not uncommon in Japan but was still disappointing. The bathroom was tiny with no space for bathroom utensils and amenities. This location is easily accessible from most parts of Kyoto but there is really not much immediately near the hotel, mainly other hotels and business towers. - The location was easily accessed from all parts of Kyoto.

While very clean, space is so small my knees were almost hitting the wall infront of me. Good luck for anyone over 5' 9\". Latches on toilet door was a tiny wire hook on one, nonexistent on another, just a groove in the wood for the latch to grab to protect your modesty. I guess for me, my issue is for the price we paied it doesn't look like she is using any money to upgrade the facilities. So I am guessing the bubble-wrap stuffed in the ceiling gaps in the shared sink area isn't going anywhere, any time soon. I think \" old Japanese style\" is just a nice way of saying \"very basic conditions\".. but they don't charge a very basic price. - The closeness to other nice locations was good.

It's somewhat on the smaller side, but large enough for a few small groups. This is a classy bar, with luxurious furnishings, chairs, sofas. Be careful since smoking is allowed in this bar, and you might end up taking a whiff of cigar smoke! I usually sat at the well-stocked bar. The bar staff were friendly and mellow. They had an impressive stock of high quality Japanese whiskey, as well as other quality drinks. I usually spent my time there sipping some Pinot Noir, or sipping a glass of Johnny Walker Blue. Don't be shy about asking the bar staff for their recommendations for nearby restaurants! As I said, the staff are very friendly, and you are allowed to buy them a drink if you wish. They can tell you a lot about Kyoto. The breakfast buffet as Amber Court was average to slightly above average. You may help yourself to either a Western breakfast (ham, eggs, bacon, coffee, etc), or a traditional Japanese breakfast (grilled fish, rice, veggies, tea, etc). Only once did I have to wait for a table. I never visited the other hotel restaurants, I'm sorry to say, so I can't render a comment on them. I stayed in a standard room. The room/furnishings were just a bit dated, but clean. The bathroom was clean. Housekeeping and laundry were efficient." .

Check In - I arrived about an hour and a half before check in at 2pm and asked if any rooms were available. I was told rooms were available, however there would be a small additional fee for early check in. When I enquired how much, they wanted just about the price of another night at the hotel, which was just absurd. There is no way around the fee, even if it was 1:55pm, as it is hotel policy. I asked if they would hold my bag and luckily the agreed to do that free of charge. Free Wi-Fi - Although there is \"free wi-fi\", you can expect that it will not work. I tired using the wifi around 10:30pm at night and pages did not load (google, yahoo, booking.com, etc). I called down to the front desk and they told me that too many people were on the wifi and that's why it slow, sorry. I asked them what they could do and they said I should try again when less people are on the wifi (this is definitely not a suitable answer). There is no option to buy better internet or hard wired internet, which is really upsetting because one of the main things I looked for when booking a hotel was in-room wifi. I woke up the next morning at 5am for an early morning flight and out of curiosity tried using the wifi, and to no surprise, it still didn't work. I feel as though the hotel states that it is a result of too many guests using the wifi, however the know that the truth is that they just don't have usable wifi. This was my third hotel stay in my trip with booking.com and every other stay was great. It's unfortunate that this hotel booking was not the same. - The room itself was nice. Similar to other hotels I stayed at, the room is quite small, however that is expected. Overall, it's a modern and clean hotel." .

But if it is not enough the host obviously tries to make quick money with foreign tourists. First, there was no Check-in with any registration according to the law of Japanese government. Then she was cheating me with the price and named an amount higher than booked on Booking and I had to argue. Further, when it came to payment, I wanted to pay with my normal credit card as it should be possible as mentioned on the invoice on booking, but she denied and said its not possible. She want only cash. After not having enough cash with me, she agreed to pay on the next day, where we haven't met her on the reception. At 22:40 in the evening she came to our room knocking heavily on the door shouting we had to pay now. After no reaction - we were sleeping allready - she just opened the door by herself. That's a violation of privacy I have never experienced in my life-long travels. Again, she wanted then to pay me cash and I said I was expecting to pay with credit card. When we tried to do so, she said her card reader is not excepting my card, with which I pay always worldwide at any place. I called booking customer service, which was no help at all. After waiting for allmost an hour calling from Japan to Germany on my own costs and discussing the case I got the reply to change the location and pay cash and what is worst: to pay the 100% cancellation fee. That was unaceptable, since the owner was intelligent enough to leave no tracks that can prove her fraud.

The biggest issue was the smoking - the hallways and room smelled of smoke. Supposedly all the rooms are smoking (which we didn't know beforehand). They can deodorize the room, but I'm not sure if they did this before our arrival. The room, mattress and pillow smelled of smoke. I have allergies so this was pretty unpleasant. The kaiseki dinner was also of a low quality. Having had other Kaiseki meals, we were surprised by the quality of the fish/meat served. Most of the sashimi we left. The cooked fish was overcooked and dry. You are also only allowed to order Japanese breakfast for your first breakfast (because they use leftovers from the kaiseki dinner). We weren't told this before we arrived. We thought you could choose either Western or Japanese breakfast. After a night of barely being able to sleep on their uncomfortable futons and old pillows (which were so uncomfortable that I slept on a rolled up t-shirt instead), we skipped Japanese breakfast. I didn't want to have anything similar to the meal I'd had the night before. We paid 750$ a night (so close to 2 grand in total with taxes for 2 nights). We knew they had a strict cancellation policy and that we would forfeit the second night room charge by leaving. We were too tired to argue for a refund and the manager didn't voluntarily offer any portion of our money back. They did pay for our taxi to another hotel which we had to quickly book in the am and pay for another night at. From talking to other people now that we are here, we've found out that there are better ryokan for a much more reasonable price. The people who work here are kind, so I feel bad writing this review. But I also don't want anyone else to get all the way here and lose as much money and a night's sleep like we did. - The staff is very kind and tried their best to help us - especially the front desk woman and our room assistant. It wasn't their fault the room is run down and too expensive for what it is. They offered to change our room for the second night, but we were so unhappy we didn't want to stay any longer." .

        hip:hasText  "While the owner seems like a nice chap, I have never stayed anywhere with that many rules! There is a restriction sign literally every 5 metres. Now we know that Japanese society is governed by a lot of (usually unwritten!) rules - and most of them make sense and are a reason which everything works so well, but this here is overkill and while I understand that as a traveller you need to stick to certain rules, the amount of restrictions in this guesthouse in unacceptable and as a host to so many European travellers, the owner should also know that for us, after paying a quite high price for this accommodation, it is not acceptable to have so many rules, or at least to be constantly reminded of them. I'll let you be the judge: In the garden: \"If you do not have a reservation at this property, it is illegal for you to cross this line. If you do, you will have to pay a stay of one night!\" (I wonder if this will be enforced at gunpoint, as there is obviously no legal basis at all.) On the entrance door: \"Be quiet at all times and be back at midnight, or you will not be let in.\" In the bathroom: \"No smoking. If cigarette smoke (!) is detected, you will be required to pay the night's stay for all the guests of the hotel\" (Again, no legal basis for this at all!) In the bedroom: \"We would like to ask you not to watch TV after 10 pm.\" \"If you need to talk on the phone, please go outside of the building so as to not disturb any other guests.\" \"Please talk quietly at all times\". And on and on it goes..... While there are good things about this accommodation, be aware that this is by no means a real Ryokan. It is just a guesthouse with tatami floors called a Ryokan, but the experience is more akin to that of staying in a cheap B&B rather than a real, authentic Ryokan. Also the \"Onsen\" which you can reserve is little more that a big bathtub. - This guesthouse (I wouldn't really call it a Ryokan) is in a nice, atmospheric area not too far from the main station of Kyoto. It is very quiet (see negative points). It seems that an effort is made to make people feel at home. The interaction is friendly - but see negative points. Not a bad option if you are looking for something not too expensive in a nice area close to transport - and don't mind having to be quiet and home for bedtime at 10 am! The guesthouse offers bicycle rental which once again comes with a lot of rules but is inexpensive and a great view to explore Kyoto or at least the surrounding area." .

The tatami annex and japanese screens covering windows gave a ryokan-like feeling to the room, which was great. Very nice wooden soaking tab. Nice toilettries, slippers, and yukatas provided in the room. Beautiful tea-cups and complimentary tea bags in the room. Overall a modern hotel with a very distinct japanese touch. A nice alternative to a ryokan, if you want an authentic experience, but don't want to sleep on futon mats on the floor." .

The beds are also very, very hard. Suffice it to say, we did not enjoy our stay, regardless of the price gauging. I changed my reservation from four nights to two nights because my daughter got sick, and got charged the highest price possible for the two nights. 30,000 yen for the first night and 50,000 for the second night. Mind you - this room was tiny, tiny, tiny. The bathroom was itty bitty - it couldn't fit more than one person at a time. This was a reservation made well in advance (two months on booking.com). When we got there, they made us pay an extra $30/night for a child that is less than 2 years old. For the price that we were charged, I could have gotten a nice king size bed at the Hilton in Tokyo for less than 50,000 yen a night! I wanted to cancel my reservation, but they said it would be 100,000 yen to cancel. Utter B.S. DO NOT STAY HERE. I DO NOT recommend this place. Go spend your money elsewhere. - The location of the hotel was well situated - close to the main area, with lots of restaurants and even a grocery store." .

The location, on the Eastern side of Kyoto in Gion, could not be better. It offers easy access to stations and buses, and resides in one of Kyoto's most charismatic spots! The onsen (spa) had hot baths, a cold bath, a mineral bath, a dry sauna, a salt sauna, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, face soap, razors, tooth brushes - basically everything you need to get clean and comfortable!

I guess people do things at various times, which helps for overcrowding in certain areas, but some person was even using a hairdryer or some type of machine at about 3 in the am, and very loud stomping, which seems difficult because you take off your shoes, but my first night there I didn't sleep at all! Not even one hour. Part of this was due to jetlag, but part of it was due to the noise. The breakfast isn't good. - This was my first time staying at a capsule hotel, because I wanted to try it out, and I was disappointed. The facilities are ok, but there is only 1 shower room on one floor, the basement, for the entire place, and it was very crowded because there is only the one. You have bathrooms on each floor so that helps. The \"spa\" experience (kinda like a small hot tub) was overcrowded, so not great either. I am glad I had the capsule room experience, but I won't do it again unless it's a really cool place. The wifi worked, and once you took a shower it was hot. The place was always clean, which I'm sure is very hard to keep up with in this type of hostel. The location is good, but actually there are other locations in Kyoto that are a little more low key that I would prefer." .

This was way better, facilities were very good, free (wifi and wired, no cable provided, we did not need to ask for one) internet. It was indeed worth the extra cost. Very good breakfast for the price (just 1000 yen) and we had a very nice dinner there too (best macha latte and fresh tofu there). Location was good as it was within 20-30 min walk from the JR station, the city center and the entertainment district. If you have luggage, choose a bus (#5,f or example), if convenient, as there is no any subway exit close by with escalators or elevators." .

I would have no problem paying for an extra bed but charging for each kid on top of that didn't seem right.

I was a little worried about the large size of their dorms (10+ beds), but each bunk it very private with a thick light-resistant curtain surrounding the bed and a personal locker big enough to fit your camera, macbook etc. And the beds themselves are a little larger than a usual twin, and SUPER COMFY.

Breakfast is served in different restaurants, usually the cueing (if at all) was minimal. Food is tasty, with a wide range of Western and Japanese cuisine. When transferring from one room to the other (as we had to book separately two types of rooms) all the luggage was transferred by the hotel staff. The rooftop beer garden is an excellent evening choice, with an \"all you can eat\" type of buffet (will be closed from late September) . For even later night program , consider the bar in the basement of the hotel. The shops in the basement are a very good option if in need for some gifts." .

Not that uncommon in Japan.... Location is excellent. We only stayed one night but would have liked to stay longer. Not so easy to find as the front of the hotel is being renovated so guests need to use a back entrance which, once you find the hotel, is actually quite nice. Go up to the second floor to reception and you soon forget about the front entrance. The bathroom shower controls resemble a cockpit which was fun working out how to use it." .

They do have their own cafe-bar with some food options on the menu that are okay-priced. - This is the cleanest and most comfortable hostel I've ever stayed at. The lighting in this building is fantastic, the wooden furniture, the space, and good breakfast options are included too (with delicious homemade bread). The location is actually perfect if you want some quiet at the end of the day away from all the crowds in the downtown area, and there are still a good number of restaurants and convenience stores/supermarkets around. Whole day bike rentals (for 1000 yen) are very much worth it, too. The city is quite flat, and the hostel is in a fairly central location between many of the major sites. The subway station is just around the corner even if you don't plan on biking or walking too much, and is a less-than-10-minute ride from the main Kyoto station." .

When planning my trip to Japan, a stay in a Ryokan was top of the list but unfortunately it's a pricey form of accommodation. I was so happy to find Ryokan Shimizu in a more affordable price range. The property does not offer breakfast and dinner (like most Ryokans) but it does offer a genuine Japanese guest house experience. The owners are really friendly and helpful and speak reasonable English. The room was spacious and comfortable and I found the mattress on the floor extremely comfortable (but I do like firm mattress normally). The Ryokan is set in a lovely quiet neighbourhood, 5min walk from Kyoto station so it's a great location for travelling to/from Kyoto and using the JR line to get to many of local sights such as the bamboo forest and inari shrine. The Ryokan has 2 traditional hot baths which you can use during your stay and I highly recommend you do, it was a fab, relaxing experience and the tea which was brought to our room afterwards, was one of the best teas I've had! You won't regret staying at this lovely, family run Ryokan. Wish I could have stayed longer!" .

I'm an asthmatic and within a few minutes of being in the room I was coughing uncontrollably. I asked to change rooms, was initially told no because we had used the bathroom. After explaining multiple times that I was asthmatic and could not stay in that room they finally agreed to let us change. We realised later the entire floor smelt of cigarettes. Even in the new room on a different floor, the smell would filter through occasionally. Compared to other hotels throughout Japan that we stayed in for a similar price, I wouldn't recommend it. - The location was good and easy access to transport." .

Hopeful for a proper view the next time. - A beautiful simple hotel perfectly located just 5 mins across Kyoto Station and Bus Terminal. The Kansai Airport Limosine is just outside the hotel lobby. The lovely Avanti Mall is conveniently almost attached to it. There is also an underpass from the hotel to Kyoto Station. Stayed only 2 nights after 6 nights in Gion. Our room and bathroom, though small, was very clean and neat. Staff were prompt, courteous and service-oriented. The buffet breakfast was quite a good spread of both Japanese and Western. Will be back in a heartbeat when we are in Kyoto again." .

The male staff in charge did not think it is his duty to get the spoon for me . He directed me to their restaurant . The girl there was even worst . She told me off by saying i cannot use their cutlery in the hotel room . I went back to the reception staff. Then only he was willing to move his butt to the restaurant to instruct the girl to give me the spoons. I have stayed in 3 different hotels in osaka and kyoto . This is the worst . These 2 staff never speak politely like the normal japanese . Morever, one of the lift goes right down to the basement where the train station is . It is very convenient but also unsafe as the lift can take any person up to any rooms at any floors without any security features ie a tap of the room card in the lift . So be careful if u are a travelling alone . I dont mind so much if the rate is a little pricey but the hotel must provide fantastic service which they dont bother. So no more staying here for me next time . - It is near to the trian station." .

It was a twin room but I was on my own; it would have felt a little crowded with two in the room. However the space was very efficiently arranged with a small open clothes hanging area, a desk and stool with sufficient space for my laptop, and a good size TV with free BBC World channel. The bed was comfortable. The air conditioning was adjustable and quiet. The bathroom was typically on the small side as is usual in Japan but was practical and user friendly. The location opposite Kyoto station is very convenient. All in all, I thought it was terrific value for money." .

The room was well-equipped and spacious enough that I felt I could relax there. The location is excellent - really close to two subway lines and major bus routes, so ideal for sightseeing, but also in a residential area where it was very quiet overnight. The staff were very friendly and helpful and made me feel welcome. If I ever come to Kyoto again on the same budget, I'll definitely consider staying here again!" .

Just under 10 minutes to walk to JR Nijo train station. Convenience store across the road, large supermarket (Life Supermarket) about 8 minutes walk (just before Nijo station)" .

Once outside, cross the street, and turn right following Hachijo Dori (street parallel to the very long train station), with Kyoto Station now on your right, and you'll end up seeing large Aeon Mall on your left just down the road.

Not my fault they made the mistake of placing me in wrong room. Halls smell of smoke. Breakfast buffet was a mix of Western and Japanese but western dishes were not cooked enough. - Location was amazing! So close to Gion, Yasaka Shrine, bus stop very near, metro close. Staff was nice but few spoke English well." .

Shelves would have been appreciated. - The hotel is located just next to the airport bus shuttle drop-off which streamlined the process of finding our hotel. Check in was easy and complete. Ms. Ishida was excellent. Our room was very small and clean. The bed, which took up most of the room, was large and comfortable. The bathroom was fully stocked with supplies. The breakfast selection was a mixture of Japanese and western items. I found their selection excellent and filling. The breakfast room on the second floor was bright and welcoming. You could use their coffee machine to make cappuccino, latte etc., and they had paper cups to take coffee and tea back to the room. A hot water maker was in the room. The air conditioning was excellent. The hotel's location on the south side of Kyoto station made traveling, dining and shopping easy. Mr. Takashima from the front desk was also very helpful as were the rest of the staff. We would happily stay there again should we find the opportunity to travel to Kyoto. This hotel provides a great base!" .

When I did ask staff if I could possibly switch , there was no hesitation and a quick response with a room change . Staff even came to help us bring down our two luggages.... again mahalo - The staff was helpful and always pleasant willing to help any situation . Very informative when asked a about directions to and from our visits to other cities . Took the time and never made us feel that we were bothering them . This was any time of the day that we needed assistance in calling a cab or finding hot bath houses or shopping malls . We enjoyed the cafe where you could order food and just relax. Marcelo was also so helpful with explanation on food choices when we was out and about. The atmosphere during our stay was splendid and to wash our clothes before returning home was a big bonus . The bathroom was always always clean and the showers were excillant after a day of walking and eating. Thank you for a memorable trip and I have some of your business cards that I can pass to friends who could be going to Japan....Aloha Also I never had a problem falling fast asleep." .

I saw some extra storage space near the reception but they weren’t enough for full capacity. But I assume people stopping here would not come with heavy luggage so this isn’t even a problem, just a piece of advice. - Excellent capsule hotel for a short stay. The location is fantastic, very convenient for sightseeing and shopping. My stay in Kyoto was a spur of the moment choice and I was lucky to find such a convenient option for a last minute travel. This capsule hotel is essential and has everything you need for a quick stay. The facilities were very clean, which is a deal breaker for me. Finally the capsule hotel experience itself was one I wanted to try to do for the longest time, and I was afraid the capsule could feel a little bit overwhelming but it wasn’t! There’s plenty of room to move around and the mattress and pillow were very comfortable. The light-based alarm clock is a great idea and it really works! You can really hear everything since there’s complete silence so an alarm could disrupt and wake everyone in the floor, so the silent waking up is very important. Overall, I enjoyed my very essential stay and I highly recommend it for solo travelers." .

(in Europe I try not to book these early check out hotels but in Japan I was not sure if I can get something better with later check out). More attractive Genius perk would be one hour later checkout. - The hotel is very elegant, staff is super helpful. Nice bathroom, good shampoo and conditioner (I normally avoid those but my Kerastase did not work with Japanese water and hair were getting very entangled. Tried local - helped well). Good mirror - lighting combination for make-up (only one of three hotels we stayed during this trip, some of them being 5 star). It was nice to have the smoking space outside the entrance door in current anti-smokers climate in Japan. (Many places in Japan have only stuffed smoking rooms with poor ventilation). Try backers next door! We tried it one day before departure and were disappointed that we did not see it the day of arrival." .

This was more like a mini apartment than a hotel. The kitchenette had the basics and I was happy to find that there was a bit of laundry detergent that I was able to use (it looked more like someone previously had left it rather than the hotel providing it, not sure). Be aware that there is no maid service unless you stay more than 3 nights. The best way to get to the hotel is via taxi or bus.

I had a large suitcase which I had to leave unsecured on the ground floor, I had a locker on the 9th floor where the showers are and I was sleeping on the 8th floor so the arrangement felt disjointed. It's certainly not very suitable for a multi-night stay because you have to check out each morning and pay each day you stay separately. There are several dozen people on one dorm so it only takes one to make a loud noise to wake you up or one person with music or snoring loud to disturb you.

This hotel is well located, just straight up the main road from the Kyoto train station - a simple 10 min taxi ride. The hotel itself is modern and cool, and the lobby is very impressive. There is a great cafe/bar in the lobby that also hosts pop up shops from local artisans. While we were there, it was handpainted scarves. They also have a room where Japanese artisans craft immaculate hand painted ceramics. My husband and I enjoyed tea, coffee, and an after dinner Japanese whisky (or two) at this lobby bar. Our room was very well appointed, and comfortable. The bathroom is huge, and featured a large wooden bathtub which was a special treat. They also had a lovely box in the room of Japanese confections for us. We slept very well and did not hear any street noise, and we were only on the second floor. Possibly the best part of our stay at Hotel Kanra was the front desk staff. They assisted with recommending to us restaurants for dinner that were hands down some of the best recommendations of all the cities that we frequented during our trip. They didn't send us to tourist spots - they sent us to REAL restaurants with REAL locals. The first night we went to a fantastic sushi restaurant near the Gion district that was some of our favorite omakase. Second night we were sent to an izakaya that only had Japanese menus...it was so fun to keep ordering and drink the night away. It was perfect timing for fall foliage, and the front desk provided us with a pamphlet of all the best areas to see the colors changing in beautiful gardens. They also helped us arrange a 4 hour tour guide for some of Kyoto's most historic sites." .

It is also on a main bus route intersection which is essential for Kyoto - don't believe them when they tell you it is a walking city. Many of the major attractions are quite widespread and you need a good transport app to connect the buses and some trains and subways with them. The hotel rooms are well appointed, but don't do what I did, and inadvertently book a Smoking room! Eek - very smelly, and they would have charged me to change the booking to a non-smoking one, so I stuck with it, opened windows, ran the air-con, and sprayed air freshener. Lesson for next time - read your booking carefully! I did not try the breakfast, as I like Japanese cuisine, except at breakfast. A couple of excellent teeny restaurants next door and across the street." .

Free shampoo and conditioner (which made my hair really soft) you can choose what kind of pillow you want, and you can change your towels as many times as you want. And the location was great. Many shops and restaurants right in the area. Five to ten minutes to the nearest station. It was perfect" .

        hip:hasText  "Sorry, but I don't like hotels that provide a smoking room in common areas. The smoking room is opposite to the lifts and next to the drinks/VOD/washing and drying room on ground floor (referred as floor 1), so the smoke does get trapped in the lifts when a smoker forgets to close the door. They should encourage people to smoke somewhere outside the premise that is permitted. Where they can improve is by providing better instructions to the Hotel. In terms of which exit to take from Shijo Station and depending on how much and how heavy your luggage is, you would hate to take an exit where there are no lifts, or walking to an exit that has a lift but is not the closest exit to the hotel. These little things do add up.. I didn't receive any detailed instructions, but because I had already been in the area previous in my last trips and I was comfortable of the area, I didn't mind taking a random exit that was close enough which didn't have a lift. Other people might stress out, especially with heavy luggage, late at night in a different city and raining... - It was everything I had expected it to be. It has the cleanliness of any Japanese hotel that is decent, the room size wasn't unexpected as I knew what to expect (like most hotels in Japan are) and I was able to sleep!! No distractions from noise which is important when you are travelling away from home for some time. I am about 5\"9 and 154 lbs and travel with one suitcase and a backpack, so there was just enough to move around the economy double room and not have issues but if you are comparing it to western size, then it is small but this is standard for hotels in Japan (in my experience). I am pretty sure you will see the advertised room size when booking a room, so make sure you read and not get caught out and mark a hotel down because of its \"small room\". If you paid for a smallish room, don't expect a big room. For those who are expecting Western sized rooms and are 6ft plus and are of bigger build, you might have issues with the room size, so check the room size before booking. Location wise, it is one of the best ones that I have stayed in Kyoto and everything is also close. Daimaru Department store is literally around the corner and there is a plethora of shops to choose from. I would rate this hotel better than the previous 4 star hotel that I stayed in Kyoto, which was located in the heart of Teramachi Dori (shopping strip) and the room size was about the same if not smaller at Teramachi Dori. This would now be my default option when I go back to Kyoto or recommendation to friends, even though I don't usually consider 3 star hotels as an option in my travel plans. The Front Desk was always helpful and especially the Front Desk girl that I was fortunate enough to get assistance from each time (I forgot to ask/read her name tag). She always had that BIG bright warm smile whenever you entered, exit the premise and when asking for assistance." .

Outside of these hours you can self check in or check out but if you need anything else it's not very convenient because the reception opening hours are probably the time of day when you'll be out temple hunting. My room was on the street side and and absolutely no noise proofing. Therefore I could hear every car or person passing by. It would be nice to have basic kitchen equipment in the room (plate and cutlery) instead of having to rent it from the staff. - The room was very large and the presence of a washing machine was a great bonus. The staff is friendly and international. It's conveniently close to Kyoto Station. The shower has a \"drying mode\" that you can use to dry your clothes (spoiler alert: it tends to rain in Kyoto in the spring ;))" .

In hindsight however I am a little angry about having paid that much for sleeping uncomfortably in a cold and bland room. - Staff (even at the front desk) speaks little to no english. This is a major issue. I think sufficient english skills are something that you should be able to expect in a major touristic city's hotel. English is not my native language but I'd be ashamed if tourists would have to face hotel staff with such poor english skills in my country. When cleaning staff forgot a cloth in our room, we just wanted to return it, however it was not possible to communicate this to any of the staff. We ended up with two fresh cleaning cloths given to us :/ - When we had sukyiaki dinner they cook it in front of you in your room, which could be very nice, however the guy who was supposed to help us was not able to say even a single word in english, was thus not able to explain to us how to prepare and eat the sukyiaki and was obviously inexperienced himself and then simply left us alone which led to the first load of sukiyaki burning in our room. It took quite some time to get rid of the smell afterwards. - Not a single english speaking TV Channel. - Staff is very nice, caring and polite Rooms are clean Food is very good" .

Lively all the time and so many places to eat nearby. Many buses and a short walk to other stations and underground. The staff are very helpful, most speak good English and they have specially printed guides on food by type for example. On a hot week, the Air-con was most welcome and very quiet. Breakfast is good but we eat more cheaply by shopping around and taking it back. We tried a corner room this time - a bit larger and by moving around the furniture(!) , it was most practical. Views from higher floors are decent and there is plenty of natural light." .

The room only came with a bed, a wash basin, tiny fridge, and a small counter. Meant really for sleeping, and not necessarily to spend too much time in as not much space to move around. If there were 2 in a room, it's best you don't move around the same time so that you have a bit of space. They spent more on making the common areas decent (which is fine, except there may be some people who gets a bit claustrophobic). My recommendation is that they add a few more places with hooks so you can hang your jackets / clothes. (Keep the rest of your stuff in your luggage and just bring out what you will need). Nonetheless, the room, although small, was designed well and beds were extremely comfortable. Still highly recommended. - They had unlimited coffee and tea (for a certain period), there was a public bath where you can soak after a full day of walking, the location was decently close to Kyoto Station, the place was very clean, the common area was very cozy (it was like one big living room with several reading materials, comfy couches and coffee), they also had a place to borrow a variety of things you might need (like chargers, adapters, board games, etc).

I was also missing kattle in the room. - Good value for money, very close to train station and easy to find. Possible to store the bags before check in. Toileters, Japanese style pyjama and slippers provided." .

Room was amazing - large, comfortable bed, great bathroom with bath and separate shower. Lighting fantastic in room. Amazing neighbourhood and a little cafe/bakery next door as well as 7/11 opposite. Easy access to public transport (metro a 5min walk, taxis easy to get). Neighbourhood has lovely shops and restaurants to explore." .

        hip:hasText  "Definitely not worth the price. I felt I was on a cruise ship. Herds of people in the lobby all the time, large groups of tourists all the time everywhere. For the same price you can still get better in Kyoto. Beds were too hard, only two pillows. Usually in hotels they offer a couple of water bottles in the room free of charge, none of that here (it's all about the details). The part I disliked the most was the breakfast. Absurdly crowded, trays ran out of food and they would take a long time to replenish. Lacked variety and quantity, and all that for a high price. After the first day, we decided to have breakfast outside every morning, wasn't worth it staying. - Convenient location across the street from Kyoto's Train Station. Plenty of shopping and places to eat. Staff was nice." .

(You can also use the ethernet cable provided in the room -- no disconnections.) - This small to medium sized hotel is clean, has very helpful staff (even with their limited English), is close to the very large, covered Teramachi shopping arcade, and is an easy walk to the subway. The rooms are fairly good size. Getting to the hotel from Kansai airport (main international airport for the region) is easy. There is an airport bus that goes to Kyoto, and it stops at Sanjo subway station -- a 5-minute walk from the hotel. (Come out of the bus drop-off area, walk over the bridge crossing the river, walk straight about 2 blocks, and the hotel is on the right side of the street.) The boulangerie next door is a decent deal for breakfast or lunch. And there are tons of other restaurants nearby. The hotel has a nice little laundromat." .

I would say this is feedback for booking.com to work better with hotel partners in ensuring the important info is displayed prominently on the website. Rooms while very comfortable are too cramped. No luggage rack provided; Toilets have tight spaces to navigate. - The staff were very patient despite our irritation at the renovation works and closure of the car park. We were provided with a free upgrade to a Grand comfort superior for the inconvenience but to be honest, while the room was comfortable, it was very cramped to consider it “grand”. So I shudder to think what a normal comfort superior would be like." .

They also provide new towels everyday. The best thing about this exeperience is the FREE breakfast, even though they call it a simple one it was still nice that they provide them.

Second, no one was at the front desk when we got there, or pretty much at any time during our stay. We had to call to contact the owner, whilst standing at the reception. Next, the room. It was pretty small; a 6 tatami mat bedroom with a private bathroom and little balcony to hang clothes out on. The tatami mats were old and had not been cleaned in a while. The room in general had not been cleaned particularly well in fact. The walls between the rooms were incredibly thin. You could hear everything. That's right, everything. The bedding had not been cleaned from previous use(s). They were covered in hairs. Seriously. It was not pleasant. The futons and underlying mattresses were also old and thin, and gave me a back ache after 2 nights. The private bathroom was tiny. I could barely step in and turn around. It had less space than the bathroom in my first tiny Japanese apartment. The toilet leaked out the back when flushed. The shower curtain had mould on it. It wasn't particularly nice. The owner was very rarely seen. She also deemed it completely fine to open the doors to all the different rooms, and keep them open the entire day! Anyone could walk into any rooms. And it was most certainly not to change the bed sheets that she went in! This place is truly terrible. We had booked ourselves in for 5 nights, but had to leave after 2. We couldn't bear to stay any longer. I've lived in Japan for over 4 years now, and have stayed in quite a few Ryokans; this is by far the absolute worst I have ever stayed at. I highly recommend staying elsewhere. Avoid this place; it's overpriced simply for it's location. - The location is very good. As is the shower water pressure. That's it, they really are the only good things about this place." .

It would be nice to have complimentary coffee whitener +/- sugar (not everyone drinks it black or bitter); a selection of tea would also be nice - some people would like the option of whether to drink Japanese tea/s or have standard teas from other places e.g. Ceylon / Darjeeling, rather than having to choose just one drink at the entrance. The staff do not provide any written information about the facilities - it would be nice to know that the wifi is available and that no password is required. However, the absence of a password makes the open wifi far less secure for customers. - The room was clean, and tidy. The decor was acceptable. There was complimentary coffee at the entrance. Payment was via once of several machines." .

Great exercise but it was a nightmare some days with all the tourists on two small pathways. - Lovely cosy, funky hotel in a really good location to explore Kyoto. Hotel room was actually a nice size and the shower was insane as where all the free toiletries. The bed was super comfortable as well and we had a corner room so had a lovely view of the city (it was also really quiet) and great light with two huges windows. You get a free evening supper as well at 9.30pm each night which we didn't know when we booked so a nice little added bonus. The wi-fi in our room would really quick 24/7. Location wise, it was right in the middle of the city so everything on the door step in terms of cafes, restaurants, convenient stores and malls. The main subway station was approx 8 mins walk depending on how many people are around as the streets in the older part of Kyoto get really crowded. Walking distance to Gion area and the lovely old part of Kyoto. I'd definately recommend this hotel as it was good value for money compared to other accommodation there and a really good quality hotel." .

We did not receive all these additional informations, so when we arrived there was no one at the reception. It was very difficult to contact any staff - it seems like there is only one person to prepare the rooms for new guests, be at reception, etc. Rooms are not cleaned every day. Room wasvery small and there was no space for clothes like an wardrobe. Also the pictures do not correctly reflect the size/ usability of the small balconies. Half the rooms face other buildings backyards/rooftops, half face a construction site. In our experience the price is way too high given the level of service. - The bed in the room was very comfortable. There were kitchen facilities and a washing machine. The hotel is close to the old town with nice temples within walking distance." .

Also, every time we ask a question, they did not seem enthusiazed, compared to other hostels we've been to (we were travelling 4 different countries in Asia). We found that there was less regulations in terms of noise at night. There were a number of teenagers roaming around all night when we were trying to sleep. We liked other service but hoped customer service was better. - A lot of facilities including common area, roof top balconh, and a big kitchen" .

While the bus can be convenient for coming back, leaving on bus often requires long waiting time. The middle-aged lady receptionist we had during checking in and out in the morning simply did not meet the standard you would expect at an Japanese Ryokan. Negative and belittling attitude, pulling papers straight from our hands and extremely impatient (even when we were the only ones checking in). Even staffs at a convenient store gave us a better service. - The rooms were well-maintained and the ryokan had a good indoor public bath. The young staffs here were enthusiastic and professional, giving us a good guide of the rooms and how to put on the Yukata." .

The hotel had a policy of keeping the key whenever we left; I thought it would've been troublesome at first, but the staff managed to remember who we were without asking for our passport or anything, so it was quick and easy to get our key back whenever we came back. The room itself is a ryokan-style bedroom, so it was a very good experience to sleep in futons. There were 3 futons, so I could sleep comfortably even though I'm very sensitive to hard surfaces. I'm sure they would have given us more futons if we asked." .

They even provided free luggage storage service near JR Kyoto Station up to 9p.m. after check out. Furthermore, it's an easy walk from guest house to JR Kyoto Station. This is the best value hotel we stayed in our Kyoto & Osaka trip." .

I lived in Japan for 3 years and have slept exclusively on futons for about 6 or 7 years, and it was the firmest I've ever slept on. - The staff are fabulous. We really felt that they were genuinely happy to see us, to have us there and to help us. They called cabs, booked the family bath, answered my questions and were so totally warm and friendly that they blew my socks off. The inn is beautiful - Japanese but solid, so big foreign bodies don't need to worry about breaking things. The breakfast was fabulous - hot, hot tea, delicious food served quickly and with a smile. I didn't get a chance to visit the bar but I think I would have enjoyed it a lot. I thought the Sakura Urushitei looked a bit too good to be true when I booked it online, but I was wrong. It's perfect. Pay them a visit." .

But I'd say it is better than many others I've stayed at previously. They do not have baggage storage service after checking out. Checkout is at 10am. There is a charge of 1000yen each hour past that, but I noticed they set the time on the machine to be 15min later to give guests some leeway. - The location of this hotel is superb. It is literary next to an Aeon shopping mall, and is in front of the Kyoto train station (200m walk). The check in/out is done using a machine, but staff is there to welcome and assist. Room air conditioning is individually controlled, not central. The bed is comfortable for a single person, but looks like it can also sleep 2 people (unlike some hotels that claim 2 accommodation but gives a small bed). You can ask for room facilities from the front desk, such as kettles and humidifiers. Free light breakfast was also given, the hotel does not charge extra for it. We had nice toasts, jams, boiled eggs, juices, coffee, instant soups. Contrary to what some reviews say, they do restock the eggs and sliced bread, but maybe with some slight delay. I would stay here again." .

Fantastic selection of high quality tasty food. Location was the best thing for me, and was my favourite thing about the whole holiday. Situated right outside the front door is a huge undercover market (great for those not good with the heat like myself) with plenty of shops, restaurants and hidden shrines nestled here and there. You're also a 15 minute walk way from Gion. Loved it here would absolutely stay again.

Not much variety of restaurants around the hotel, but plenty of stores to buy food if needed. - Good hotel with spacious rooms and comfortable bed. The welcome drink every night is just a great treat after and intense day visiting Kyoto! Staff are friendly, and although I wasn't able to enjoy, the public baths are a great chance to relax. Location wise, it's about 15 min walk from the main train and bus station, so quite handy to commute every day. Staff was supportive and friendly when we had requests." .

Why do tou accept then reservations if you can’t offer the reserved room? 2. Why do you demand full payment without informing about the characteristics of the room? Handicapped room with a view of the dirty structure of the market right in front and 1,50 m away from the window. Paying almost 200€ the night I don’t expect a view over the temples of Kyoto but at least “a view” and not a room like in a bunker. We were asked in an intern survey if the receptionists smiled properly during the check in. Seems that’s more important... The rooms seem to be ok. Unfortunately very noisy so that you can hear everything from your neighbors and the elevator. For the price and service it’s a bad value. Definitely I will not return. - New hotel, location is very central." .

This hotel is located in a great location downtown, close to restaurants and shops and the covered arcades. It is easier to take a taxi to the JR Kyoto station if you have luggage, although it is only a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest subway stations. We booked 3 twin rooms for 6 people and the room size was good for 2 of the rooms, and somewhat smaller for our room which had a pillar in it. The hotels in Japan don't provide luggage racks, so we ended up putting both suitcases on the desk. There is a fridge with 2 complimentary bottles of water which seems to be standard for hotels in Japan. We used their laundry facilities on one of the floors, which was clean and automatically dispenses laundry soap." .

There was a washing machine in the basement with a massage chair while waiting for the washing to finish. We had the Japanese breakfast which was very filling and meant we could skip or just have a light lunch. Staff were friendly. Great stay." .

Is not a major issue, but something you need to be aware to plan your days. When arriving/departing with luggage from/to Kyoto station I will definitely recommend taking a taxi, will cost only 10 USD, and will prevent damaging your experience. The staff very kindly helped us call the taxi, and even walk us to it!!! Rooms are not 100% soundproof, we had the bad luck of having some rude neighbors one night that woke up us, but is something that happened only once and was solved within a couple of minutes when they settled down in their own room. - It is the second time I stay in this hotel, because I have always had such a wonderful experience. A friend of mine recommebded this hotel the first time I came, and he has also stayed more than once. We stayed in the traditional Japanese room. It was an amazing experience, we loved everything in the room and the common areas, the decoration was absolutly beautiful, the hotel itself felt like an attraction worth seeing. Staff were super nice and helpful with everything, did not hesitate to go the extra mile recommending how to move around and special activities in the city during the season we visited. Location is very close to one of the most pupular touristic areas (Nishiki market, Shijo street...), which is very convenient, is also kind of central to other places to visit. The neighborhood is nice and quite (which was a plus for us). Did I mention how nice the staff is?? Amazing!!!" .

We accidently left one of our backpack inside the train on the way from airport to Kyoto on our very first day arriving, with passport inside, the staff make an effort to help us by calling the station, thankfully we retrieved the bag back, or else the trip would be a nightmare. The Location is right in front of Kyoto Station, just 2 minutes walk, Yodobashi department store is right beside the hotel, where you can find all sort of foods on the 6th floor, and many other stuffs. I seriously recommend this hotel if you want to stay in Kyoto." .

It looked like some previous guest had used it to cook food or something; there seemed to be small bits of food in the kettle. When we informed the staff of this, they gave us a brand new kettle that looked like it had never been used before. The wifi connection was terrible. It would only work for a few minutes before it disappeared, and then it would come back, and so on. The bathroom door is see-through. This means no privacy when going to the bathroom. If this would bother you a lot, it's probably a bad idea to stay in a double or twin room with somebody at this hotel. The hotel should really reconsider this flawed design. - We only stayed two nights, but we used the public bath both nights. We got a great deal through booking.com, but even if the price had been higher, the public bath alone would have been worth it. It was lovely and relaxing, and it was included in the price. The bath is open until 1 am. If you go there around midnight, it won't be that crowded. For those who might not be sure, by the way: Yes, the public bath has separate areas for men and women. It would have been wonderful to be able to bathe together, but it's common to have separate areas like this. When we arrived, the hotel upgraded us (free of charge) to a larger room with two single beds that could be pushed together to form a really giant bed. Most comfortable bed we had on the entire trip. Great mattresses, pillows and comforters. Another plus were the full pajamas provided (pants and shirt) instead of the usual yukata. I love yukata, but this was a nice change. Guests are allowed to wear their pajamas when going to the public bath, too, which was very practical. The rooms also have an electric kettle, a fridge and a large shower stall with a rain function. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel, as well as a 7-Eleven right down the street. I must admit I expect friendlier staff than this in Japan, but they were okay. Most of them could speak English." .

I got a bit mixed up so don't be like me and make sure to double check which one you've booked so you don't get confused when asking for directions! - The staff were super lovely and helpful when we asked for anything. The room was supplied daily with toiletries and bubble baths, pyjamas etc... which made our stay even more comfortable. The room was comfy and super clean. The hotel is on what seems to be the main street of Kyoto, from the Imperial Palace all the way down to the train station (2 subway stops either way) and in perfect walking distance from tourist landmarks and lovely places to have dinner. Although Kyoto is busy, the room was quiet which meant we got a good nights sleep every night before going on adventures during the day. Absolutely loved Kyoto and recommend this hotel!" .

The walk became tiring, especially under cold weather. Besides that, to get to Kyoto Station we had to change lines which takes a little bit more time. Although there are no gym facilities in the hotel, the extra walk probably helped considering the amount of food we had throughout our trip. Nevertheless, everything about the hotel was perfect. - The bedroom is clean and all necessary amenities e.g. bedroom slipper, pajamas, water boiler, toiletries (shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, razor, toothbrush etc) are provided and replenished when necessary during housekeeping. The bedroom size is considered above Japanese average room size. There is a constant supply of hot water shower and the design of the hotel itself is modern and new. 7 eleven and Family Mart convenient stores are just next/opposite the hotel which is very convenient. The Omiya station is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel, where we can easily take the subway/train to Arashimaya (direct line!) or other parts of Kyoto. There are also a few food options around the hotel and the hotel receptionist was very willing to provide recommendations. Pastries served during breakfast were yummy, although breakfast selection could be limited. However, if you only require simple breakfast, I would say this is just perfect!" .

Also there's no one at reception after a certain time which isn't very convenient. I checked at 8.30pm and no one was there. Luckily I found a note on the desk with my key on it, so no big deal. Finally, I think the word \"ryokan\" is not very suitable for this place. My room had no kettle, or tea bags, or anything else (like a yukata), that to me makes it a ryokan. Don't expect to be in a traditional Japanese house. Basically it's a small relatively new building with rooms on each floor.

Drinks in lobby at night are great but bar staff at night was not very friendly. Also, we had a large group and moved some chairs around so we could all sit together and the staff was watching us like hawks and looked quite unhappy until they eventually asked my sister to put her chair back and swap it for a different type of chair?? Not very nice to ask your guests to move if you ask me. Especially since we weren't bothering anyone and place was not full at the time. I also saw them tell other guests that they were not allowed to eat outside food in the lobby. Not friendly either. Lastly, the rooms were a great size but the hotel itself could have been cleaner. The walls and all the carpets (in hallways and in rooms) were stained. The chairs in all three rooms we booked were also stained. This should be taken care of because it gives the whole hotel a feeling of being unkept/unclean. - Good selection at breakfast. Great location, easily accessible to Kyoto Station and local subway and buses right outside of hotel entrance. Room sizes were great for Japan. Bath was nicely maintained and was great fun to get Japanese bath experience at no extra charge. Free nightly drink in the lobby was a nice perk! Fantastic price!" .

We came late for the breakfast time, but that was fine to have the late breakfast too. You can bring the breakfast in the room, which was nice though. There are coffee and tea i the common area you can always drink, with the computer you can use. The location is close to the shuttle bus. There was a seven eleven just round the corner.

Went to bar for a nightcap and was shown to a closed room that was very hot an was charged a cover fee of 1500 yen just to sit an look at the wall . For the price we paid for this hotel I think it was too expensive. - Staff very helpful.Breakfast good." .

Firstly, regarding location, it is super easy to find if you spend couple of minutes looking for it on the Google Maps, it has the location tag there. When you get our of the Yamashina station, just cross the level crossing and you will see the Racto building, the entrance is just near the taxi stand. About staff, okay, they don't speak good English like most Japanese, but my check-in and check-out was the fastest ever! I didn't need to say even a word. And yes, learn a little Japanese before coming to Japan, will be a plus" .

Theres a convenience store about 1min walk away and if you need some home comfort mcdonalds too. Excellent budget ryokan in Kyoto highly recommended if you just want somewhere to lay your head and leave your stuff." .

Washing facilities were also great and clean. The location of the guesthouse is perfect. It's about 30 minutes walk to the central station, but close to many of the biggest temples in Kyoto, including a short commute to Fushimi Inari. I would definitely stay here again! The hosts were very lovely, and there was even a suggestions board and what to see and do when in Kyoto!" .

Aside from the reception, the hotel seemed outdated, the beds were rock hard (and not just in the typical Japanese style, I literally got no sleep at all), the bathroom was a letdown and the overall experience felt very shoddy. As big a disappointment as we have had on booking.com, we have had better hotels in the U.K for £35 a night rather than £180 and a planned move to a cheaper hotel in Kyoto has proved far, far better. Sorry if this is harsh but we feel taken advantage of, paying that much for this room. - Leaving baggage with the concierge went well. Decent location near train station" .

Design is beautiful with view to a wall with plants, something like a Zenbuddhist garden idea combined with capitalist wish to make money with rooms that otherwise wouldn’t because they are inside the building. Great disadvantage is you don‘t get daylight, day and night feels just the same, and in the morning you do not feel awake untile you leave the hotel. Feeling ibecomes claustrophobic after the second day, also in the night always white noise sound of AC even if you turn your own off. Had to sleep with ear props. In addition I find it very inhospitable and disrepsectful to ask the guest to pay at the arrival in advance. On top of that, if you want to make a simple national phone call from the room, you are asked to go first to front desk, buy a „ticket“, then go back to room, then make call. Owner is either control freak or seems to think he is running a students‘ dorm. - Location, design" .

It was like being in hospital, the same goes for the bath but at least it was like an hotspring except there were no chairs or wash cloths. The rooms were only cleaned once in 4 days so the bed was unmade and the towels were wet. The room was the width of the bed so it made making the bed and getting in and out of it difficult. Also the room was dim and the window difficult to reach to change the air. For this price I've stayed in far better hotels. - The community lounge area was comfortable with lots of interesting books, Jazz music playing and real tea & coffee which you could help yourself to.

Walls are Japanese thin, if you feel uncomfortable and want a little privacy during your night-time snoring *wink*, then maybe you're better off booking a western style hotel. - The staff spoke great English, were super professional, friendly and extremely helpful with anything you would need. They gave me recommendations and directions of shrines, museums, restaurants, events, how to get their and what to eat. Kyoto Station is 20minutes away on foot if you like walking as I do." .
