The employee at the front desk just shrugged his shoulders and said no higher manager is available to discuss this issue. Won’t stay here again and discourage others unless you don’t mind paying premium for awfully spotted room, see my images before booking. - The location is great. We were able to walk to Tsukiji Fish market, Tokyo Station and Imperial Palace. There are several temples in walking distance as well. Easy access to the subway." .

You can see Tokyo Tower from this area, which is also nice. If arriving from the airport, take the Nartia or Haneda airport limo bus to Shiba Park Hotel and it's just a 5-10 minute walk over to this hotel.

Other hotels filled out our request slips to send luggage to the next hotel but here you had to fill it out yourself.

If staying as a couple I would recommend staying in a larger room. My father also stayed in an economy double and said it was very small for just himself and had no idea how we managed. - The hotel is smack bang in the middle of Ueno, a 5 minute walk from the train station and right by a beautiful lake and parks. The hotel view overlooks the park which was lovely and the museums and zoo were about a 10-15 minute walk through the beautiful park! Very useful for travellers who needed a break from the trains! The staff were very friendly and incredibly helpful! They ran up a robe and towel when I was using the onsen (a beautiful public bath in the hotel which was very lovely and quiet) and wanted to book the hot rock sauna for then and there. The breakfast was nice and offered a good selection of Japanesr and western foods. The room came with lots of things (razors, toothbrushes, foot massagers, kettle and tea bags etc) and was cleaned everyday. The bed was quite large for Japan and super comfortable! Overall it was just a really nice hotel!" .

It actually made me and my friends angry because I saw there were some other snowboard bags in the storage room and I believe I wasn’t the only one who requested for the service. And the way he acted was so insincere. I was so surprised I m getting this kind of service in Japan The room was too hot and the temperature was controlled by the hotel so nothing we could do about it. - The bath tub and the toiletries were awesome. Space wise was ok as I expected a small room in Tokyo Area anyway. High security." .

Our \"standard\" room was barely bigger than a king-size bed (so with a full-size bed and a desk, there was literally no space left). Don't expect to fit your suitcases if there are multple - ours were in the tiny area next to the door and we moved them EVERY time we needed to exit the room. There are two clothing hangers so if you have more than 2 pieces of clothing you cannot unpack them - there's no space provided for any storage. This room is intended for a few nights stand for a solo business traveler with a small suitcase and it really doesn't fit anything more than that. We had a normal-size window but it was facing the other building so closely that we got zero natural light. There's no fitness room and no gyms within the reasonable distance that would allow single-visit patrons in. The staff was totally not helpful when I asked about workout options. If you expect to do some bodyweight exercise in the room - see above, you don't have a chance. I am 5'8'' tall and I had to go outside to the elevator hall to find space to do some pushups - basically forget it if you want anything more than that. - Their breakfast is reliably good although same every day. They serve the usual Japanese breakfast food: miso + kelp, rice with nori and sesame and seaweed, eggs, several kinds of fish, warm boiled vegetables with some seafood. Bread is not great but ok (we had a choice of some buns, mini-croissants and some sweet danish). The rooms are very clean. The mattress is good. The AC works fine. The place is 20 min walk to Tokyo Station and the neighborhood is great." .

I feel sorry for the staff that work here. - Location was the only benefit. I was swayed by the positive posts of reviewers on multiple sites but was deeply disappointed. My kids were horrified. It was a great lesson for them - a motivator to do well in life so you don’t have to stay in places like this." .

I found the hotel difficult to find once I got off at Shidome Station, had to ask some people for help, which I got. Maybe having some directions in the subway and what exit to come out of would have been helpful - This was an \"Arty\" hotel therefore a bit different which I liked. On the 31st floor you could go and have a look at a couple of the rooms and the artwork on the walls. Cost extra to be in these rooms. Shimbashi station is close by and they have some good eating places down by the station. Saturday was buzzing and my friend and I found a nice little place to eat at outside. Great ambiance. I would recommend this hotel even though I think it is over-priced." .

I thought we had ever walked past the front desk without hearing any greetings, which is quite unusual for the customer service practice in Japan. 3) The major disappointment is the MATTRESS. We have two rooms with two single beds each. On the first night stay, for both rooms, the single bed mattress just sank in at the center when we laid on it, while the side of the mattress remains leveled. On our next three night stay in another room with twin bed, we had the same experience for the mattresses. The overly soft mattress at certain spots (which seems to be a worn-out condition for me) did not give me a good sleep, even that I had to maintain the same sleeping posture, that is, lying on my back. Not to mention lying on my sides, my whole waist simply sank into the soft mattress. Overall, the mattress conditions for our two types of room (single bed and twin bed) are below satisfactory. Furthermore, the super thin pillows that were originally placed on the beds are also super low for our neck, and we had to ask for more pillows, which turned out to be the normal thick pillows that we see in other hotels. So, is there a reason for providing such super thin pillow in the first place? 4) The breakfast is not fantastic. Only two staff, one cooks and one serves. Small restaurant. Two of us had one side vegetable missed out on our trays, which is unusual for the customer service practice in Japan. - Location - Near to subway station and train station.

Not a ton of night life but we didn't mind too much - just hopped on the subway to Shibuya or Shinjuku!

There is a beverage vending machine by the elevator which had some delicious hot lemonade (which I had never heard of before coming to Japan). I was expecting a small room because, ya know, it's Tokyo, but the actual living space was a bit bigger than I'd expected (enough room to put our stuff and move about freely, plus a nice desk area)! Plenty of charging outlets and the climate control/humidifier were easy to use. The design of the hotel is modern without feeling forced upon you, and it was always very clean.

The 7th floor corridor carpets were really dirty and stained, as they were on a previous visit 2 years ago. I mentioned this to a Reception staff member who commented that other guests had complained about this and that these carpets may be replaced. While other hotel chains like APA are opening new hotels in this area, the MyStays hotels look expensive and need updating to compare favourably with the competition. - The location just 5 minutes walk from Ueno station was great. The single room was OK in size but lacking in some features like bedside reading light. Reception staff were helpful and courteous. Just a 7 minute walk to Kappobashi (Kitchen St) with amazing array of crockery, kitchen ware, restaurant supplies etc. A very good local restaurant, Tianjin, is just diagonally opposite the hotel and serves really delicious food, especially the large savoury pancake Ekonomiyaki, in various styles. The owner chef and his lovely wife have some English and are very happy to share their English menu. Delicious food!" .

They do not entertain early check-in or late check-out requests unless you pay for it. Every hour costs ¥1500. I stayed in Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa last year and they offered early check-in and late check-out for free. - No service. I requested for additional towels and a knife. The reception told me that I have to collect the towels at the guest service counter on Lobby level and they only have plastic knife. - Interior of the room is very dated. The wallpaper in my room has peeled off. - No thermostat to control AC. I can only select low, medium or high. - AC vent is loose and kept making click click sounds throughout the day and night. - Limited tv channels, no English channels at all. - Lack of power points in the room is a huge minus. There are only 2 power points at the dressing table opposite the bed. The points are next to each other. If your charger is too bulky, you can only charge one device at a time. Being opposite the beds also meant that you can't charge and use your phone while lying on the bed. - Cleanliness is average. I can see stains on the bathroom door and black marks on the pillow case. - Hotel website claims that their beds are from Simmons. However, the beds are extremely springy and somewhat shaky. I also found it too hard for my liking and I can feel the springs popping against my back. - Limited limo bus timing to Haneda airport. They only have 2 timing to the airport which are in the morning. So if you are taking a late flight out and lugging a lot of stuff, you need to brave the train and crowd. - - Location (right opposite Shinagawa Station) - Contour pillows - Water pressure is good - Water temperature is good - New slippers daily - Room size is good" .

Booking.com, please post better directions! Unfortunately, I had to give the bathroom a low rating because there was mold in the grout of the tile. This is very strange since the rest of the room was so clean. Also, Omori station is not the most convenient train station. You have to take the Keihin line to get to a major hub and transfer. Although the address is Shinagawa, the nearest station is not Shinagawa! - It is relatively convenient from the train station. It is a short walk, approximately 10 minutes if you are walking slow. You can get there in 8 minutes if you are a fast walker and are not dragging luggage. The rooms are very comfortable, and I was able to get a triple room (unheard of in Tokyo). Most Japan hotels make you book two rooms for 3 people, so I appreciated this option very much. The breakfast is very tasty with a wide variety of options. It's included in the price which I found to be a bonus." .

Although I read the specs, I did not expect it to be such a big place and could house lots of guests, but it was very spacious. The lobby and lounge areas were very nice. Nearby, there are information sheets and \"posters\" for sites to see and things to do; these were very informative and helpful for some planning. The kitchen was a place were a lot of activity and mingling happened, it seemed like. If you are interested in meeting other travelers, this seemed to be like a very friendly and welcoming hostel where everyone seemed to be really nice to each other (well, perhaps it does depend on the crowd and timing). The dorm room where I stayed was very practically set-up. I was grateful to be able to borrow a (spacious) locker and padlock, but I probably didn't need to get it in the first place. I did appreciate that the bunk bed was mostly made/supported by metal; this gave it a solid, sturdy feel when I had to climb up and down. Even then, the bed was comfortable; I also appreciated the draw-curtain to keep to my space at night and in the morning. The availability of a power outlet and night-light were helpful as well. There were unisex restrooms available, but there were also \"gender-specific\" ones, for those who needed more privacy. Aside from the overall cleanliness, which was generally okay, these had showers and toilets that were separated out conveniently and well-stocked with soaps and toilet paper. I would like to now stress the incredibly amazing customer service that I received at the front desk. I made quite a difficult inquiry/request from the staff, but I did find some resolve to my issue, greatly thanks to the staff who aided me." .

Location is the best part of the hostel, shops and restaurants are just walking distance, even a 24hr mcdonalds is just beside and 24hr grocery is just a few meters away. Train station is just 7 mins away. Staff are very helpful, We arrived earlier than check in time but they did allow us to use the shower and bathroom to freshen up. This place is great!!!" .

I really had bad luck with bed 408 since it's next to the very loud door. It seems there are no hotel rules, people where arriving at 2 a.m. making noise with their luggage, chatting till after midnight and the provided slippers are also noisey on the hard floor. I just had no sleep at all for 4 nights so for me the place totally failed in fullfilling my basic need for a few quiet hours during night. Anyway the mixed dorms seemed to be quite okay since there are only 8-10 persons in one room. - Nice area in tokyo, nice design, very friendly staff" .

Getting to it by subway from Narita airport is a little complicated; having a Sim card installed so you can use Google maps or something similar will be of great help for navigating the system. I was able to hear one of the trains from my room, but it was quiet enough to just be a vaguely comforting background noise. The neighborhood around the place is pretty quiet and finding a place for dinner took a little more effort than I expected. Still found some great food, but breakfast is especially tricky. I recommend trying the hotel breakfast once, since it is convenient and tasty, with a good variety of both Western and Japanese food. The rest of the time, just go to one of the nearby 7-11 stores to use the ATM and buy some bao or onigiri for a cheap simple meal. - Lovely and comfortable, and a great place to rest after a long flight. I love the bit of greenery and flowing water at the entrance. Signs near the hotel made finding it easier. The room was pleasant and comfortable. The bathroom was quite nice; both the shower and the bath were enjoyable. Breakfast is a bit pricey, but quite good, with plenty of variety. The fresh pajamas every day were a great touch." .

My room was very cold and although I was given a heater, there should be a heating button the air conditioning system. It is very much geared for business travellers and maybe it should be taken into consideration that amenities for them are not the same for the tourist trade so some adapations need to be looked at - The hotel was close to two subway stations, the fish market and many places to eat. The staff spoke very good English and helped with directions to places and also lent me an umbrella when I needed it - they also booked the airport shuttle bus which was handy, and were able to send two packages abroad for me. The staff in the restaurant were pleasant as well." .

We had to hold the shower rose with one hand. while showering. Not a deal breaker but it was not comfortable for us. - Service and location. Friendly and respectful staffs. Close to the the main eating streets. Quick automated check out system. There is also a 7Eleven on ground floor right outside so was great for us as we arrived very late at night from airport. Very clean room and the room we got had a great view of ueno park." .

Additionally my bathroom was not entirely clean, hair from the previous visitor were still lying around and on the toilet.

The bed was a little uncomfortable and if you are a light sleeper I recommend wearing earplugs. My first night there, I was placed in a capsule next to the door where guests enter the room and it made a noise EVERY TIME someone came in or went out. So that was annoying. But, I when requested to move to a capsule further away from the door, the staff moved me without any trouble. Great value for your money, but be aware that when you stay at a hostel that you would have to give up some comforts. - I really liked how clean the facilities were and how convenient this location was to Tokyo Disneyland/Disneysea. I stayed here because it was the closest and cheapest hostel near Disneyland (only about 30 mins away) by train. The Shinonome train station is just about a 5 min walk from the hostel and there is a Lawson nearby. It's also convenient to getting to other tourist parts of Tokyo as well.

First of all the hotel is completely out of the center of Tokyo and far from the near metro or monorail station. It will take about 40 minutes by metro or 4000 yen to go to Shinjuku, Shibuya, Roppongi or Ginza. Second be aware that the room are very very noisy. The room, and I changed a few because of the noise, are all overlooking a high speed way which goes out of Tokyo and the double glazing is very poor and not efficient. You can literally feel the glass vibrate when cars or motor bikes go by. I could not sleep all night because of the noise Third staff is very rude and completely unhelpful, from receptionist to duty manager. I have never been treated so badly in a hotel. Fourh the rooms are very bad value for money and need a refurb. Only 2 power plugs available in the whole room, carpet wear and tear, beds are uncomfortable.

Toaster not available...only a very slow toasting oven. Service was good but the waiters kept taking away the place mats and my utensils along with my plates! I was not finished with my meal! I had to ask them to set the table again. This happened everytime during my stay. A sign should be available to indicate whether guests are done with their breakfast buffet meal. It was annoying to see my table cleared out when I was not finished with my meal. (Just been eating for less than 30 min)....Cocktail hour and afternoon tea at executive lounge was disappointing. Not much variety of hot snacks available during cocktail hours. Not many cakes or sweet snacks available during afternoon tea time. Some muffins were rock hard to bite...generally dry and not moist....Been to hilton shinjuku lounge last year and the lounge had more food.(dimsum, fingerfood...etc) Improvement with food quality and variety is definitely needed. - Executive room was superb~Checking in and checking out at the executive lounge was great. Very friendly staff especially at the executive lounge~^^ Spacious room and charming view of the rainbow bridge~Awesome location. Daiba station is right next to the hotel. Close to shoppingmalls and convenience stores." .

My rooom had a lovely view over the park and the lake, and I enjoyed the fresh air by opening the sliding door..the room was very bright and airy and very clean., and had an assortment of toiletries, and a robe to relax in..or feel like a Ninja or Karate expert ..so comfy after being out all day. Because it would be too much to reclimb the 6 floors I decided not to go out to eat,,, and around 8pm, the lovely receptionist Wu, arrived with a plate of local food which was very tasty...such unprompted kindness, is hard to find, and at a personal cost to to Wu, ....I offered to pay but no way would Wu accept. Next morning I met Naoki, the young man who checked me in, and he had heard I was moved to a higher floor and he was sorry I had to walk the extra floors...so he presented me with a gift...some chopsticks and a lovely china bird to rest then on....all too much for me, and the tears appeared...such overwhelming kindness to this senior, but still young in mind with no attitude problems was me on the receiving end of such genuine thoughtfulness from these young staff members, promoted by their own concern, not just doing their job." .

The body wash, shampoo and conditioner was Shisheido. All toiletries needed were there, from cotton tips to shavers." .

Basically those lines take you anywhere. More tricky to use the JR loop. * Room is big for Tokyo standard, also with a big LCD (mostly Japanese channels). Bathroom spacious (concerning the standard) but having good pressure and hotness concerning baths (that's a plus for me). Good amenities as well e.g. dental, bath stuff, etc. * Handy phone (new generation) with free local and some international calls and free 4G internet. Never used because I had a pocket Wifi. Wireless free of charge also available everywhere. Also amenities for charging. * Reception is good but English is not so well; just for basic. Auto checkin/checkout available - we just used for checkout. Coffee free of charge available every morning; didn't try the breakfast - usually prefer to give a try to the local establishments." .

They offer a small lounge for guests on this floor where you can get some drinks in the evening and a small breakfast in the morning. Also there is a coin operated laundry and drying machine on one floor. If you want to visit Odaiba the hotel location is very good as it is connected directly to the Yurikamome line." .

The rooms were small and had zero storage space for any clothing and had just one luggage rack. When we asked the front desk if we could have another luggage rack they made a big fuss about it and gave us attitude. The staff at this hotel was absolutely horrible! They did not speak one word of english and did not even try to help us one bit. One morning it was pouring rain so we had asked a member at the front desk to call us a taxi for that afternoon to go to Tokyo Station... We were travelling from Tokyo Station to Osaka with luggages and needed to catch the shinkansen by 1:45PM. The man at the front desk said he would call for a taxi...at 12:30PM as we were packing last minute things our room phone rings and the man at the front desk tells us that there would be no taxi coming because he didn't call and that we should just go outside and find our own taxi in the pouring rain with 2 luggages. Unfortunately this wasn't the only issue I had with the staff at the front desk. They are completely unprofessional, rude and unhelpful which is unlike the Japanese. The breakfast was terrible, same thing every single day! If you do not like eating fish and curry rice for breakfast you are pretty much stuck eating croissants, cereals and yoghurt your whole stay! This hotel was really not worth the money and definitely put a damper on our stay in beautiful Japan. I have stayed at other hotels in Japan on a previous trip which were amazing in comparison to this one. I will definitely be visiting Japan again but I will never, ever be stepping foot into this hotel ever again! - The only things I liked about this hotel was the location and the cleanliness of the hotel." .

The next day, I needed help bringing my luggage to the airport limousine and a staff member came up immediately to assist me once I made the request. He was polite, friendly and very professional. This is really a very good hotel to stay at and I will definitely return here for future stays!" .

Even as a no-frills \"business hotel\" this is very nice and felt like an upscale property (except the room size, which is quite small, which we knew about in advance as we did not need much space.) The staff were extremely friendly. Location is close to the fish mark (easy 10 minute walk) and close to Ginza and Tokyo Station. Would stay here again -- have not stayed in other APA hotels so do not know if this is common with all APA hotels or this one is special, but I do recommend it." .

Wouldn't stay if I had known. Single bed was more comfortable than the double bed. The double bed was bouncy and the pillows were not comfortable at all. And there was stains on the doona in the double room. Air con was cold but it was noisy all night long. Also, on the first night, there was no teabag or coffee in the drawer and no water either. Second check in, got team coffee and two bottle of water on the second day. Kind of random. There is also only ONE washing machine and ONE dryer on the ground floor. You might have to wait long at night to get your washing done. After washing my clothes, I found black marks all over my white clothes. Felt dirtier than before wash. Won't recommend using it. Room was small as most people have described. I managed to have my suitcase open in the upgraded double room. Not a chance in the single room. Definitely not for big suitcase traveling. Also, be mindful when you use the bathroom, as the curtain doesn't block the water completely so you might end up with a wet floor. - Stayed one night at the single room and two nights at a double room. Single bed was much more comfy than the double bed. The single room was located on 11/F and when I checked in a second time for the double room, they gave me the 5th floor. I asked them if there's a higher floor room available, they gave me a free upgrade to the 13/F. Took me a while to find it the first time, but after that, it's just an easy walk to/from the station. Good selection of free amenities to use including hair band and sponge, which not all hotels provide." .

We though it would have been no problem to organize with the hotel in Japan the shipment via courier of a purse … wrong !!! First of all there is no e-mail address you can contact, you have chances only if you book or cancel a room. Our communication went on through Booking.com that we used to book the hotel in the first place and that is not a direct a useful system. After few brief messages from the hotel saying that the cost to ship it back was high and that I replied to let me know how much it costed and to give me quickly an account number to transfer the money to …. no further replies from dai ichi hotel !!! incredible and this is Japan one of my favourite counties that I visited for 25 years ! One of the places with the best service standards in the world ! I thought of calling a lawyer but then my wife decided to block all the cards and documents and consider cash and the other documents lost … Even Booking had not been of any use. No phone numbers I wrote them explaining what happened and no reply after 72 hours ! ( thay say the reply always within 24 ! ). So Booking too like the hotel has easy access to book or modify your reservation but no service if you have the minimal problem whatsoever ! Whatch out !

The washing machine the previous guests were complaining about was working just fine. In the fimale dormitory room there was no kitchen but still it was a fridge, a table and a cattle to boil water which was totally fine for some basic needs. Be ready to take your room card with you all the time because all doors of rhe facilities will automatically be locked after you exit the room. In the hostel there was no noise or buzzing atmosphere.all the time it was very quiet so it was a good place to take a good rest, too. Location was very good, It's just 300 m aways from the metro station Minowa. It's not too far away from the down town area. But still it's not too close and next to Shibuya, too. This hostel is.a lovely place to stay and the price is very good for the service they provide." .

I’ve stay for 3nights in female dorm & really safe. The best things is for female dorm , you get to ask for amenities free everyday. You can get free bath towel everyday as well. I had pleasent stay and definitely will stay here again in the future." .

Neat and basic, a good headquarters for exploring Tokyo." .

I only stay at them when they turn out to be the cheapest and most convenient hotel for the timeframe. If you're looking for character, or something with a more leisurely feel, go somewhere else. If money and location are your priorities, these are just fine. - But as always, they are clean, the buffet breakfast is nice and has a large variety of options (far exceeding your typical American 'continental' breakfast), and the bathrooms are clean and very well stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothbrush, and other useful travel items, and the water is nice and hot!" .

The cleaners were very noisy every morning. You feel like you're staying in a hostel than a proper hotel. Stayed here for 4 nights but couldn't get good sleep at all. The room is too small your bed is literally 5 steps away from the door. The bed is not comfortable. Suggest to pay a little bit extra to stay at Comfort hotel (500m away) as it is so much better than APA. - The hotel provides toothbrush, facial lotion, comb etc" .

There's a Don Quijote (popular chain of souvenir/food/anything shops open 24 hours or at least very late) a minute walk from the hotel where you can buy snacks and drinks." .

A negative point (not observed during previous stays at the hotel) was that the bathroom was not too clean and that there was some mold on the curtain of the shower. My previous minor negative comments are still valid: 1. The hotel is difficult to find. I would strongly encourage the hotel management to put up a sign on the street. 2. The building is located near a large (2 leveled) road (the first impression isn't great, but upstairs the road is not visible and does not disturb in any way). - This was my third stay at the Hotel Lifetree Ueno. I like this hotel very much. It is located on the upper part of a tall building and provides beautiful views over Tokyo. It is modern and clean. The rooms are nice. The staff is friendly. The breakfast is ok (but I have tried much better in Japan). The proximity to Ueno is also appreciated. I intend to go back on my next trip to Tokyo." .

Didn't like the exorbitant cost to use the beautifully presented and marketed garden pool (about $50 AUD ea - this is outrageous given the tarrif). Great location and partnership with Disneyland, but no shopping in this area. Very little to see and do if you go for a walk. - We liked the courteous and helpful staff - customer service was excellent. We liked our room which was clean and comfy, and had a great view to Skytree Tower. We liked the shuttle bus services to Disneyland, and the help to book us an Airport transfer. All excellent. Liked the adjoining East21 plaza containing a convenience supermarket, fast food, a Japanese food outlet, coffee shop and a bakery." .

I don't believe this to be a true negative, because I knew that going into the booking but just be aware so that if such a thing would bother you, book elsewhere. Staff were friendly, helpful, and breakfast was good.

That would be nice :o) - I think this Hotel has a very, very high standard and I just had everything I needed in my room. It was just a perfect place to stay in Tokyo.

For business travelers, especially if you are planning to stay for several days or more, it gets pretty claustrophobic.

Better than I originally guessed - once I had been there for a couple of days I really came to appreciate not only it's proximity to the train station (Ikebukuro station on the inner loop), but this location and absolutely loaded with great places to eat, ranging from very nice, upscale to street-side, stand-up eating bars. Also, very close to some very nice shopping, all within easy walk of the hotel." .

There is the Toei Sengakuji station beside the hotel for those who want to visit places like Tokyo Skytree/Tsukiji Fish Market/Asakusa however for those wanting to go to places like Harajuku/Shibuya/Shinjuku/Tokyo and would not like to walk then perhaps they may consider a hotel closer to Shingawa JR station which has a circular route. Do not expect any of the spa to have a view of Tokyo Tower and viewing deck available is small and not suited for staying out in Winter. - As with all the APA hotels, the furnishings were fairly new and identical to all the other APA brand hotels but this branch along with the Asakusa branch have the added bonus of having an indoor and outdoor spa at the top floor of the establishment. Staff are friendly and able to communicate in English. Some hotel rooms can have a view of Tokyo Tower." .

The beds are okay, but they are just made of plywood and steel frames which is very... cheapskate compared to the amount of rating the hostel haves. I've stayed in at least 8 places with the same price that didn't use plywood and steel frames for their capsules. The floor was simply concrete. We stayed in the fourth floor which was a women-only floor, but we had no bathtub at all on the floor. If you want to use the bathtub at the fifth floor, you have to go downstairs, talk to the receptionist and have them open it for you. It's very annoying as they ask you over and over \"what are you going to do in the fifth floor/why do you want to go there?\" when I clearly stated \"please let me use the bathtub on the fifth floor\", IN JAPANESE. One more thing: I stayed with two of my friends who didn't speak much Japanese and the receptionist didn't let them use the bathtub due to communication problems. The other hostels I stayed in had the bathroom installed outside the dormitories so we didn't have to bug the receptionist every single time. A little extra information: I found a big dead bug (around 3cm) in my capsule on the first night. They probably didn't clean the place thoroughly. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. - The location, but to be honest there are better options." .

We had chosen this hotel mainly because we wanted larger rooms than the Tokyo average. Additionally, it is also near the Tokyo Dome area, which is an outdoor theme park (free to enter, pay for rides) with a lot of restaurants outside of a large Tokyo Dome stadium and LaQua spa area. When we stayed there was a concert going on many of the days for Hey! Say! Jump! and the area was incredibly packed with younger girls going crazy. It was really hard to move around the area and trains were packed. If you stay here and plan to explore, it might be worth seeing what events are happening at the Tokyo Dome." .

Breakfast was expensive for the cost but the food was good. Service was top notch, which is typical for Japan. They did mess up the order, but we could only order in English and it wasn't a majoe concern to me. - Room was as expected, the Japanese Tatami with futons. Upon arrival the room was setup with a table and they advised they would come up between 6-8p to switch to the futons. We had gone out so found that setup upon returning from visiting around Tokyo. Extra pillows/sheets would be nice. Also some instructions on how to use some of the equipment would be nice as well since they have a full information booklet about the hotel sitting right there. We didn't have the luxury of looking around much, we arrived in Tokyo without reservations and luckily Grand Arc had a room available and was close to the Imperial Palace where we wanted to be." .

Interestingly, on one morning they rearranged things to put more tables in the room and all the food in the hall. This worked much better. Anyway, not a big problem and we would 100% return to same hotel. - This is an excellent mid-range hotel choice in Akasaka within easy walking distance of three metro stations and multiple metro lines.

I was told that the closest JR station from the hotel is Ueno, which is about 20 minutes walk from the hotel, so can be a big deal for JR Pass holders. - The location near Senso-ji Temple is great, lots of shops, restaurants nearby, shopping complex on lower floors, Don Quijote just opposite Richmond. Metro station is not far from the hotel. I stayed in a single room and it was pretty spacious (in comparison with other 3* hotels I'd stayed in Tokyo before), upon check-in I was offered to choose some cosmetics like a hyaluronic face mask, face lotion, creme, etc. There is a central A/C unit in rooms with individual control, worked properly, had no problems with that. There is handy in rooms which you can use while you're in Tokyo (I was there just for one night, unfortunatley didnt use it) Was quite shocked with breakfast, it was very superb: salmon, beef, chicken, sushi, cheese plate, great salad bar, fresh juice, fruits and even blueberries...so make sure you come earlier and have a great breakfast :) (which is till 11 am by the way, not 9:30 like in most Tokyo hotels) Definitely recommend this hotel!" .

The funny thing about it is that they have free bath cloth for you And first day that I arrived I've got it about S or M size but I am a plus size woman So it was a little uncomfortable to wear But they changed it everyday So second day and on I've got bath cloth about XXL size everyday. I love it. It showed that they care about their guest. (It's not their fault that they didn't know at first that I am a plus size Hahaha) Overall it was very very very good 7 nights to stay there.

I appreciate the air purifier in the room but being able to open the window a crack could help. My guess is the mold can be found between the bath tub and the wall next to it. - I liked especially the price and the amenities on the woman's floor. Such a great idea! I loved how close the hotel is to everything and everyone of the staff was so friendly and helpful." .

All staff were very professional and friendly, from cleaners, to dining, to reception. The location is a short 7-10 minute walk from Shinjuku main station, or a couple of minutes from the subway.

It's perfect for a short business trip or a night out on the town, but if you're a couple making an international move with several pieces of luggage, it's a real struggle to move about your room. I would have liked to have bought vouchers for the breakfast buffet ahead of time so we could have saved some money, but I think that either the hotel staff didn't know enough English to bring it up (and didn't want to try to explain it in Japanese to foreigners) or assumed that foreigners wouldn't want to eat at a yuba restaurant, so I wasn't aware of the promotion. And a word of caution on the coin laundry available on the first floor: just like every other dryer in Japan, it takes hours to dry a load of clothes, so plan accordingly! - The yuba (tofu skin) restaurant in the first floor of the building was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast buffet there was delicious and had healthy vegetarian options. Note that in addition to Japanese breakfast food (salad, fish, miso soup, tofu, various side dishes), there is also yogurt and fruit, toast, eggs, and one type of cereal (Frosted Flakes?) for those who prefer western breakfasts. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. It was an OK distance to Ikebukuro Station, and from there, you can get anywhere in Tokyo easily. Other reviewers have mentioned that this part of Tokyo is \"seedy.\" True, it's not Azabu or Ginza, and there are more girls/snack bars and hostess clubs than you can count (and even a gay bar or two--good for you, Ikebukuro!), but I've stayed in worse areas of Tokyo in worse accommodations and I never felt unsafe in this hotel's neighborhood." .

Maybe a few more choices on the Western breakfast...we find japanese brekky hard to do, but the some more fresh fruit would have been good. - The Life Tree Hotel is perfectly located for Ueno visitors. Close to the train to the airport and a short walk to Ueno Garden and National Museum site. It is also close to the night market area ad planty of food choices available. However, what was best about the hotel was the separate toilet/shower facilities in the room...most rooms have the toilet in the shower area. It was beautifully appointed with plain simply colours and very tasteful. This has by far been our favourite hotel in Tokyo ever....we even expereinced an earthquake while there and felt so completely safe with the building movement and re-assurance from staff that everything was fine. I should also mention the views are INCREDIBLE!" .

I used the dryer twice on the same load hoping it would work but my clothes were still kinda wet. Laundry is somewhat important for me when I travel because I usually travel light so I can have luggage space for souvenirs and gifts. The elevator is kinda slow but its not that big of an issue - This was my second trip to Japan and my second stay at Grids Nihombashi. I really like this place. The staff are all very nice and helpful with accommodating to requests and suggesting places to go. The location is great for commuting. It is nearby multiple subway lines. Asakusa Line, Shinjuku Line, and JR Sobu Line. The location itself is a residential area, so not really a lot of places to go to within walking distance, but there are places to eat in or grab snacks. There is a Yoshinoya, 7-eleven, FamilyMart, and a diner named Jonathan's. There are also more restaurants to eat in on the Edo Dori street that the Sobu Line follows. The place is extremely clean. If you didn't know it was a 2-star hotel, you would think its a 4 or 5 star hotel from how clean and new everything looks. They have cleaning service at least once a week and they do a fantastic job of keeping all the areas clean. This is a pod hostel but the pod is very spacious and I did not feel claustrophobic at all. The bed and mattress was very comfy and I always slept comfortably every night without feeling bad the next morning. The sleeping area has a powder room with security lockers for important belongings. Theres one toilet in the powder room and more toilets outside by the elevator area. There are also bathrooms on every floor. The lobby floor also has a cafe called Streamer Coffee. Although I am unfamiliar with the store chain, it is very popular in Japan and rightfully so because they served some very delicious coffee. Shower rooms are on the 2nd floor. The showers are all very spacious with good water pressure and hot/cold sensitivity. The showers also have stock of shampoo, conditioner, and body soap so thats just a few less things to worry about packing for travel amenities. The common lounge is also on the 2nd floor. It has a TV, smoking balcony, and room for about 10-15 people." .

This is a definition held by some people but for some it means 2 rooms next to each other with no connecting door between them. Whatever the case next time I have to use the term connecting rooms. The hotel did say I was getting adjacent rooms (not even adjoining and definitely not connecting) which I somehow did not see, ..so my daughter slept in one room and I in another. The 2 double rooms (initially there were supposed to be 3 of us) were small and the toilet smaller than any other place I had been to. There was no sink in the toilet and the kitchen sink doubles as your toilet sink. - The location was good, about a 5 minute walk to the JR station and Keisei SkyLiner for Narita Airport. The metro/subway station was rather far, I was told it was a 20 minute walk away. So if you had bought the metro pass you would still have to take the JR train to the nearest JR station with a metro/subway station adjacent to it. We (my daughter and I) ended up going to Ueno daily by JR train to take the metro Ginza line or the Hibiya line. The room was equipped with a microwave and electric stove top but you have to get the kitchen utensils and cutlery from the reception counter. The room though small had a tiny cupboard with a number of hangers to hang my clothes in and there were also under the bed containers or boxes to put stuff in. There was also a long desk in my room which was good as I had a lot of stuff to put on it and I put my bags under the desk. The desk in my daughter's room was smaller though. Being Muslim, I had just enough floor space in my room to perform prayers." .

If you want to get a better service, spotless clean room and whatever you will have to pay more. That is what I thought!!!! - This hotel is a really value for money. The hotel is very close to 2 Tokyo Metro lines ( Ginza line and Hibiya line), JR Yamanote line and Keisei Skyliner, Ueno Park and shopping places (Marui department stores and Ameyoko open air market). 24 Hoir convenient store is located just right next to the hotel." .

We had to walk our luggages for nearly 1-km just to board the connecting train. Recommend this hotel if you're planning to go to Disneyland/sea area but find the hotels in the resort a bit pricey. This hotel is much friendlier budgetwise. But if your plans are based around central Tokyo and esp. if you have many luggages with you, the hotel's location is a bit inconvenient IMO. - The public baths on the second floor is quite large compared to other hotels in Tokyo. The room is just about the size you would expect to pay at this price." .

        hip:hasText  "The Hotel was hard to find, so before arriving, I advise to find it on GoogleMaps so you know exactly how to get there. Overall, the hotel's room was quite smaller than I imagined and there was no wardrobe, and this was quite off-putting. I was there for a fortnight ( two-weeks ) and as I had paid nearly a £1,000 for the room , so I expected something a bit more than a 'basic' accommodation type room. However, after speaking to the other Guests ( Japanese ), the hotel is considered like a Japanese business 'Travelodge' for commuters. My view also backed out on to the side building next door to the Hotel so I never got to see any of the Tokyo skyline. I did ask for a change of room with a better view, but was told that the bed size would be smaller so I left it. However, this was the only time that I have encountered a hotel not providing anything 'extra' for a Guest staying for a fortnight. The bathroom was also a bit small, and it took me about three days to work out how to use the combined bathroom sink tap/ shower tap. This hotel would be fine as a 'one-off' but I wouldn't recommend it if you intend to return to Japan in the future. For what I paid for, it doesn't provide great value for money, and may be ideal for a three-day / four day travel. - The Hotel itself is in a good location, about a seven minute walk away from Kanda Station, but its exact position is on the corner of a busy road and flyover. It's also in a safe neighbourhood as well, and a good ten minute walk away from Akihabara. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful ( although they're not as fluent in English so you'll need to brush up on your Japanese ! :) ), the breakfast is worth consideration, and as a freebie, you'll get a free bottle of water very day if you participate in the Hotel's eco-policy i.e. if you don't need a cleaner / domestic for your room." .

We upgraded the room to a superior room with a slightly bigger bed. The service was not what one would expect of a four star property in Tokyo, however. The staff were curt, and difficult to communicate with, partially due to the fact that they hardly spoke English. They were unable to help out with dinner reservations at restaurants or book taxis unless you were personally present in the lobby. This was a bit unpractical, as most restaurants open later in the day. On one of the days we stayed, we received an e-mail that due to electrical tests, we could not access our hotel room between 12:00 and 17:00. This was fine. On our last day, when we requested a later check-out of one hour, the front office required that we pay a fee for this. We thought this was a bit unflexible, seen as we had not been able to access the room for five hours the previous day. They would not budge on this, and were quite unfriendly about it. I would not recommend the hotel breakfast, which seems to have been outsourced. It only costs ¥ 1300 per person, and has a varied buffet with a rather odd selection. Runny scrambled eggs, green eggs, watery miso soup and orange juice marked \"freshly squeezed\" even though it was from concentrate, pulled down the experience for us. - Great location in Shinjuku, close to public transportation, yet in a quieter neighborhood. The bathroom amenities were great, as were the shower products available. An extra plus for clean and crisp PJ's in the room." .

At the reception you can get free coffee and as many toiletry as you need. On the bathroom you have a big soap, big shampoo and big conditioner available to your use. Very well equipped room with even shirt hot press." .

The hotel was walking distance to 2 separate stations on 2 different lines. Good breakfast." .

I am fairly experienced so it was no problem for me, but it may be for others. - Although not a traditional Japanese hotel with tatami floors, etc., it had a more traditional Japanese hotel decor and feel to it than other standard hotels. Also, the property is located in a very quiet neighborhood which is nice for sleeping with the window open." .

If you stay in the dorm, roommates is unpredictable. If your roommates is nice and respect others, you are lucky. I stayed in the same room in 12 days. Some people are nice, but some are not. 3. The air-conditioning in the room is weak at night for me. 4. There's a window in the dorm, but the window was blinded by the heavy curtains. So the natural lighting is limited. 5. There is few places to hang the clothes out. 6. The wifi speed get slower sometimes. (specially at night.) - This is my first time to stay in capsule hostel, and it is a great experience. First of all, I really ENJOYED the automatic toilet! While you open the door, the stool will lift the lavatory cover itself, not to mention the bidet toilet, it was AWESOME! XD I was super impressed that hostel in this price got these kind of facilities! Second, the material of the \"capsule bed\" is OK, so you won't hear much noises if your roommates change their sleeping position. And if you are the short girl like me, the size of the bed is good. I can even do some yoga or stretch on my bed before sleep. Also, they clean your bed and change your towel everyday as your wish. The location of the hostel is great!! It is closed to the Akihabara station. There's some local shops here with very low price. For example, My favorite drink is POCARI SWEAT (ポカリスエット). The drink in vending machines in Tokyo everywhere normally about 150 to 180 Japanese yen. But you can get one POCARI SWEAT from the vending machine here for just130 Japanese yen. Last but not least, although I speak English, it was always delighted to meet the Taiwanese staff at the front desk!" .

        hip:hasText  "Our party booked eight rooms for three nights, and also the function room for a day. Since we were arriving early, I called up the hotel a few days before arrival to request if we could have at least one or two rooms for early check-in at 9 am so we could freshen up before our planned tour at 10. The lady who answered my call said we could only check in at 11 a.m. and even then we had to pay for that. I asked to talk to the manager, but he said the same thing. So I wasn't too happy about not getting even this small concession. But when we got there, they actually gave us a function room where we could leave our luggage and get stuff so we could change our clothes. So this made us all happy. All good in the end. - The room was big by Japanese standards. The location was excellent, with many eating places nearby, the Sensoji temple really close, even the dock to take the Sumida river cruise was a quick walk away. Shopping was also good, with a Don Quijote store a minute away, the Rox shopping mall, and the Nakamise shopping street for souvenirs were all quick walks away. The buffet breakfast was also excellent." .

(I am not a smoker, more over I traveled with my young daughter) But they gave me a smoking room even though I complained many times. I found out that there was a notice \"we cannot not guarantee your smoking preference\" which would be displayed only if I press a small \"exclamation mark\" button in booking.com reservation menu. This is almost a cheating. My booking information in \"My bookings\" menu of Booking.com also showed very clear Non-smoking emoticon. I used Korean version Booking.com when I reserve, and I found later after check-in that this notice is especially nasty in Korean version compare to English or Japanese version. Please check Korean notice below, and feel the difference. In Korean notice, you cannot know this smoking option selection is not guaranteed until you read to the last sentence. 1. Korean notice (I translated to English) : You can SELECT smoking environmental CONFIGURATION in room here. If you don't have a preference, keep the \"...\" selected\". Warning! Please be informed that we cannot guarantee the environmental configuration which you selected\". 2. Japanese notice (I translated to English) : Choose whether you hope(or desire) for Smoking / Non-smoking room. If you don't have a preference, keep the \"...\" selected\". Warning! Please be informed that this is not a confirmation. 3. English notice : You can select your smoking preference here. If you don't have a preference, keep the \"...\" selected\". Please note that we cannot guarantee that your selected preference will be available. - Near Asakusa Sensoji." .

Definitely recommend for budget travellers who want to save on budget dinning. Easily assessable,to major train stations with JR Suidobashi station.Many food options around.Can walk to Tokyo Dome for relaxing shopping and dinning experience if you are too tired to go to the main city." .

Bathroom is only just big enough for a medium size manual w/chair and the shower chair is placed on the bathroom floor to shower (water drains away quite well), alternately shower is over bathtub. Location is fabulous as so close to amazing Kannon Buddhist temple, market area, loads of restaurants, also walk to train station, easy to access with wheelchair, even an elevator up to main temple area !" .

The first page is writing, Nanjing Massacre is a fake stroy from China. My grandma still remember the scene that Japanese troops killed many chinese civilians in World War II. Japan never acknowledge the damages that they bring to China and other asian country. I feel so bad about the book and I hate Japanese militarism very much. - Very close to the downtown. But it takes 30 min to find it from Tokyo railway station, because the buildings and streets are very similar in Tokyo. Then we found a subway station very close to this hotel. The room is very clean and comfortable, like other Japanese hotels." .

The hotel is close to the metro station." .

The room was cleaned well daily, with a comfortable but very soft bed and the staff were very pleasant and keen to help, though they did deny I was staying at the hotel when a friend tried to contact me, speaking both English and Japanese and with my room number.

Once found, it was easy to find again and the location is very close to Ueno station. - The morning I left I needed to find a post office but it was Sunday so the local post office was closed. I found online that there was a 24/hour post office 2 subway stops away, but the website was unclear whether this included Sundays. I asked at the desk and the two gentlemen were so kind and helpful. One tried calling the post office while the other looked online for more information. They were able to confirm that it was open. They provided such caring customer service. I felt well looked after." .

Room size is 15 sq m^2, so it’s proper for one or two travellers. Bed size is around 130 - 150 cm, not that big, but still it’s quite comfortable. Lawson on the ground floor. JR Asakusabashi - west exit is only 2-3 min walk" .

We took the airport monorail and changed at Shimbashi to the Ginza line for 3 stops, it took us approximately 40 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel and the journey was very straightforward. The hotel has plenty of bars and restaurants on the doorstep but at the same time it is not as busy as the central areas, the central and more touristy areas such as Shibuya and Shinjuku are less than 10 minutes away by metro. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful, they will go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay. The rooms were clean and modern, a bit on the small side but this is typical of Asian hotel rooms. The hotel provides free toiletries which included make up remover, toner, moisturizer, shampoo and conditioner, body wash and body lotion. This made it very easy for us as we only took hand luggage and so did not have many toiletries with us, it saved us from having to buy some on our arrival in Tokyo. The room also had a USB phone charger which was very convenient. We had breakfast included in our room rate, the breakfast buffet was not huge however there was something to suit everyone including a range of Asian (noodles, congee, curry) and English foods (bacon, eggs, tomatoes) there was also toast, cereal, bread, cheese, jam etc as well as tea, coffee and a range of juices. For what we needed i.e. a comfortable place to sleep and a convenient location to explore Tokyo it was perfect. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others who are visiting Tokyo for the first time." .

There are walking and sitting space within the room even after opening up 2 non-cabin-size luggage bag and a haversack. House keeping team did a very good job in keeping the rooms spick and span. On top of that, they also brighten up our morning with their greetings! The lobby executives demonstrated great hospitality. We were looking for Nikko Grand’s Bakery, the lobby executive did not simply show us the direction, he actually walked us to the Bakery! Bread from Nikko Grand's Bakery was our most preferred during our whole tour in Japan. Train station is conveniently at the door step of Nikko Grand. The Odaiba Rainbow bus from the bus stop in front of the hotel’s lobby takes us through the rainbow bridge, and arrive Shinagawa JR Station in ~ 30min. Nikko Grand is also within walking distance from the bay area & shopping/dining places." .

This was NOT stated anywhere upon our booking in the first place. A let down as you expect a service to be working, for them to take out money. We had to leave the window open slightly to keep us cool. -One of the big reasons in choosing this hotel was, stating they had a coin operated laundromat. A big part in choosing a hotel in our regards. Although we were told that the laundromat is off-site some 400m away, which is not even run by the hotel. It is a private laundromat that the neighborhood use and run. I would call this deception to the hotel guests as all we could go off is the description of the hotel. And to also add salt to the wound, they do not offer any service for coin exchange, as the laundromat only accepts 100yen coins. -If you decide to have breakfast on-site, make sure to pay at least one night beforehand. Otherwise they will charge you an extra 200yen if you pay the same day you wish to have their on-site breakfast. Again, this was never stated anywhere in the booking description nor hotel paperwork. - -Close to Shimbashi station." .

It is just across the street from the Tokyo Dome and an attraction parkl / shopping mall / restaurants / supermarket complex, a lively, well kept area where there is always something going on. The room was modern, clean, and very quiet and well kept, and tea / coffee bags were provided as well as an electric kettle. You can get complimentary bottles of water if you put the eco card on your door (means no change of sheets that day, but yes, room will be tidied up). The towels were very thick - nice! and the bathroom supplies like toothbrushes, etc. resupplied daily. There is also a washing machine or two on one floor as well as microwaves so you can heat your own food. The room was very quiet in spite of location by a road. The space in the room was smartly used. A couple convenience stores are situated along the same street and there is a fairly simple but good ramen restaurant at the corner, one where you make your choice on an automate, pay by the machine, get a ticket and hand it over to the staf. The rest is standard and a helpful member of staff will jump up to help you if they realise that language is a problem." .

Even when we had difficulty finding other places open an a weekend, we weren't tempted to eat there. Maybe it's brilliant - who knows? - but as people who can get good Italian at home (literally - my family is half-Italian) it didn't appeal. - Rooms were spacious by Japanese standards, and the hotel provided not just in-room or pocket wi-fi, but an unlimited use smartphone for guests. Not such a bonus for me as my phone is set up for roaming, but great to give our teenage kids so they could go off independently when out and about, knowing that if they got lost, they'd have Google Maps to get them back to our agreed meeting spots. Drink vending machines on every floor also went down well with the kids. The location was very convenient to the Haneda Airport Tokyo Monorail, and the hotel was happy to hold our luggage after check-out until a late-night flight." .

Finally, after going with the receptionist to the room and let him see for himself, I was given a new room - at this point the 2 hours \"Genious early check-in\" were gone. As for the room, it was not properly clean, there was some hair in the bed and the walls and air conditioning filters were disgusting (see photos), when I turned on the A/C, all room smelled like dirty socks. In general, the room had a 'worn down' feeling. This room was also close to the cleaning staff's material closet, this means that every morning I woke up with noise. Finally, for the late checkout, I again had trouble - the cleaning staff knocked to the door and couldn't understand the concept of late checkout and, since I couldn't be bothered anymore, I just left this nightmare hotel. - I like the fact that I won't stay here again." .

There was only one case stand; the other had to be on the floor which made the space even tighter.

Their hangers were very thick, so even if we asked for more, they wouldn't have fit on the hooks they had for them. (We needed more, I think there were only 6) The location wasn't too far away from train station, but wish it was closer. My suggestion for hotel is have numbers for taxi, or other shuttle transportation handed to guest at checkin. Also, I had met a couple people who had a pocket wifi, and said the hotel rents them out. That would have come in handy but nothing was said to us about it at check in. The staff were friendly, but this location wasn't one of the English speaking staff. The people in front desk spoke a little bit of english, but the rest of the staff didn't. Wasn't a problem for us, the staff were very patient, and we figured things out :) - When I was doing a search this was one of the only hotels that had a queen size bed. The bed was comfortable enough, and the comforter was very cozy and warm. The cleaning and restaurant staff were very nice. We had some tours scheduled early, so went into restaurant 15 minutes before they officially opened, and they let us. We really appreciated that! I really liked how many amenities they put in the room. From the pictures on the website, I didn't understand that they place all those extra items in the room, I've never seen that done before. ...it was really nice to have it there, if you needed it. They might need to take pictures of toilet too....the toilet had a Bidet.:)" .

However the bed and pillow were quite bad, didn't got the rest I needed during my stay. Worst of all was the housecleaning. At the end of my trip they had the nerves to go through my stuff, throw my bag in a corner and leave most of the contents scattered over the floor. The next day I hung up a do not disturb sign and after being gone for a quick trip of shopping I came back finding out they ignored the sign all together. The location of the hotel was nice, but I would not recommend anyone to stay here after my experience with the disrespect housekeeping has for your privacy and stuff. - Only positive thing about the trip was the location." .

But there were small things that made me not satisfied to full scale. Rooms with a view to train (I dont consider this a nice view and I asked twice (booking form, checkin) to have a nice view since it was our last night in Japan) are set above AC ventilation, which is a little bit noisy even with closed windows. Also, I dont think the location is very usefull if you want to visit city repeatedly becase you have to take train from independent provider every time to get to main subway system (but the journey itself is very nice with selfdriving trains and nice view of The Rainbow Bridge). The breakfast seemed to have a smaller choice than I am used to at 5*hotel and to get a coffee took some time (nobody around, twice asked..). Basic spa facilities not included in the price of the room. - Well, to be honest I expected too much and I was disappointed a little. This was our last night in Japan after 3 weeks of travelling through different places (private, hotels, hostels, ryokans) and we wanted something special and treat ourselves. But truth to tell, after all welcoming places we visited and caring of our hosts, this place, even very nice, luxurious and clean seemed to us cold and impersonal. Very comfy bed. Immediate checkin (even before scheduled time), later checkout for free (one hour). I liked concierge service that kept our luggage until late evening when we departed to the airport. Tea and coffee facility in room (maybe a nespresso machine would be nicer). Location is ok for shopping in the area and relaxing on the beach." .

Upon entry to the breakfast room we were given a plastic tray from the 70s. That devalued the whole breakfast experience which was a shame! The breakfast was ok but more geared towards Japanese guests I felt. My room was generally clean. The bathroom was a strange maroon colour, again very 70s. The hotel was ok overall but I am not sure whether I would recommend it. - Quite a nice entrance and helpful staff. The room was ok but a bit on the dark side. I was glad to have a non smoking room! The location was good, quite close to the metro. Generally very quiet which is a bonus." .

Would also have been better if hotel was within walking distance of urayasu train station. However these are not faults of the hotel. - Enjoyed the late night/supper buffet that the hotel catered for tired & hungry guests who returned after a long day at Disney. Enjoyed the public bath the hotel provided for guests. It was amazing to shower at the bath and then soak in the hotel water. So refreshing and relaxing. The bath house was so well-equipped with all the toiletries one needs. Quadruple room was comfortable and spacious with 4 single beds. When we put 2 large luggages on the floor there was still more than enough room to walk about. I liked that there were 4 separate “hangers” on the wall for each of us to hang up our coats and winter wear. Room rates from booking.com wee reasonable." .

The only place to leave my large suitcase was by the front door which resulted in the door not being able to open fully. Aside from thosr aspects everything else was fine. There was no English options on the free TV (though paying for unlimited access is very cheap. I also wished there was an easier way of knowing whether the single washing machine and dryer were occupied. Several times I caught the elevator down and it was constantly being used, so I'd have to go back down to check again later.. And it would then be used by someone else. Very annoying process.To have the hotel wash the clothes themselves cost quite a lot compared to the $3 washing machine and $1 dryer. - The staff all spoke English which helped me a lot. The hotel was in a convenient place for me, as it's only a short walk to multiple subway stations, many cheap restaurants, close to the palace and only a 15 minute walk to Ahihabara (My favourite place in Tokyo).The bed was also very comfortable.Also, I appreciated that the hotel has taken a 'green' approach and don't wash all towels and sheets daily." .

The staff were extremely helpful, giving us a towel to dry ourselves when we came in drenched from a sudden storm, and extra pillows for an injured arm. We were able to leave our luggage at reception on the day of departure, so that we could explore the neighbourhood for a few hours before heading to the airport. Although the hotel is in the heart of busy Ueno, it is fairly quiet and we weren't bothered by noise." .

Both wired & wireless were available, and I got 90M up / down, and got a public IP too. It doesn't get better than this. Bed was comfy, and lots of pillows. Black room maid spoke better English than Japanese reception. They should upgrade her job!" .

Sometimes we got complete cooking appliance & dish soap and some others we did not. And the kitchen shelves could have been cleaner. - I do appreciate the staff & management for allowing us checking in earlier. Because as far as I know hotels in Japan apply sort of rigid rules on check in/check out. And also thank you for keeping our luggage safely while we were away of the hotel! The hotel is located in a quiet block near the Ueno and JR Ueno station. So you can have easy access to public transport but at the same time get calm ambience of the surrounding. The hotel is suitable for family or even solo traveler. Family with toddler can cook meals for the babies since they have rooms with cooking appliances and mini kitchen facility. I will look forward to staying at this hotel again." .

The young male staff was being extremely unhelpful, he just threw me a form with no explanation at all. I asked if he could help me to call my next hotel to let them know my suitcase is coming, he refused(with passion!) even I offered to pay the phone charge. He insist that I shall ring them myself, I said I can't speak Japanese and his reply was:\" we are a hotel and we can speak English, so I think they can speak English too.\" Because of this endless insist(with poor English) I nearly missed my train and not been able to send my suitcase to my next stop. - Location not too bad, although it is 10 minutes walk from either subway stations.

Unfortunately when we booked all that was available for one of the rooms was a \"smoking\" room. I had no idea how much a \"smoking room\" retains the overpowering smell of smoke - it penetrates everything, even the towels stunk which is not great after freshly showering. I would not stay here again if all that was available is \"smoking rooms\". Otherwise, go for it - great for staying the night before a flight out of Haneda, and the included transfer shuttle was very convenient." .

I was extremely disturbed by this, as I explained that they have an infestation and need to make sure they fumigate the entire hostel dorm to make sure they stop breeding, as a number of other pods had tracking marks on the beds so they are obviously spreading between beds. I was very disappointed by this given the high ratings and how nice and expensive the hostel is. The facilities are clean but they obviously don’t clean the sheets / beds properly.

Hotel staff, from reception to house keeping are very friendly, always smiling & happy to help. Rooms are immaculate, felt very relaxed & bed extremely comfortable. Features like having a kettle with tea, coffee, water, snacks, fridge, charger, neck, foot, back massager, good selection of toiletries in bathroom all made the stay even more better. Breakfast was sufficient enough to start off the day, had both Japanese & western food to choose from. Other facilities very useful such as microwave, washing machine & vending machine. Spa was excellent, with onsen & sauna, perfect to come back to after being out all day." .

They do have spaces for big luggages in the room but it isn't as spacious. So at times you kind of have to wait until others are done tidying up their luggage before you can start taking things out or putting things in from yours. However, this was not a major issue for me as I did rent a single capsule instead of a private room so it was expected. Also, people were very respective of the everyone in the room so it is always quiet day and night. so if you're one of those people who are looking to talk and chill after hours in the room with your mates then a single capsule option is not the opyion for you. Better book a private room. - Everything is new and clean.. The toilet, the shower room, the bed (mattress,pillow,quilt) all very pleasing. The AC was fully felt in the capsules as well and this was super important as I stayed during summer and it was pretty hot all the time outside. The coin laundry was provided and easy to use, even if the drier seemed a bit weak. The common room had utensils and microwave and a kettle and toaster as well as a TV. It was a good place to just chill and talk after a long day walking around the city. They also have a fridge for you to store your food so that was good. The staff are friendly and helpful. Will definitely recommend others who are not on a super tight budget (a litttle bit more pricey compare, just a tiny bit pricey to other ones that I have stayed in) but still want to save some money in comparison to renting a private apartment/hotel to stay here as it is worth every penny." .

The breakfast was very nice, loads of choice between savory and sweets, eggs benedict and much more. An extra plus is that you are also allowed to exchange your breakfast voucher for lunch, so in case you want to sleep-in you can still sit down for the lunch from 11:00 on. Very clean rooms, friendly staff who are very polite and ready to help. Location is great, especially if you're planning an early trip to the fish market / tuna auction, which is only a 20 minute walk." .

Location was great, right next to Akihabara station." .

There were shelves attached to all the beds so you could have a nice personal space to stash things not just under the bed." .

Fantastic views from the lobby and hotel rooms that makes going to tourist spots like the Tokyo Tower a little pointless. Located in a business area that is quiet, clean and modern but walk to the other side of the station and you get access to various restaurants and bars in a more traditional bustling Tokyo setting. So the best of both worlds. Staff are beyond friendly and helpful. I would definitely return." .

No way to turn off automated hallway light so I had to keep the bathroom door open at night to block it. - This was the tiniest room I've ever stayed in but they utilized the space well and it's the center of Tokyo. Location was excellent for getting anywhere in Tokyo. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Excellent bath on the top floor. Breakfast was a little basic but filling. Bed was comfortable by Japanese standards. Quiet room other than the highway noise. Had a great massage here. Light controls in room allowed you to change the amount of red,yellow, blue light. Glad that they efficiently gave me one set of towels when I requested towel service (instead of full cleaning). I've been to far too many eco hotels who give you two sets which sort of defeats the purpose of the system." .

Food & drink in the hotel is expensive.(Although very good) Much cheaper to eat in the town. I was annoyed with Booking.com as we needed to check out a day early, I tried to amend the booking 4 days before the stay began but your website said I couldn't amend even though the confirmation said I could change until 24 hours before the stay. We had 3 rooms on the booking so this cost us an extra 3 nights. Quite poor. Hotel wasn't able to do anything as the booking was made via Booking.com - 3 different restaurants to choose for at breakfast, my favourite was the healthy one which was stunning food beautiful presented. Also has a gym and lots of local amenities close by. Closer to Haneda airport (20mins) than Narita (40 mins)" .

We travelled all over Tokyo from this hotel with ease. The room was small, very small, however it was clean and comfortable and the shower had amazing pressure!, there was good air con and the beds were comfortable. There are all 3 major convenience stores within minutes walk from the hotel, infact the Lawsons store is in the hotel. There are about half a dozen nice little restaurants in the area and a large supermarket, again all within a minutes reach of the hotel. There is also the Onsen Spa on the second floor which is really lovely, and if you don't mind getting nude with the locals then its really quite relaxing!" .

The bathroom door was a commercial type sliding door that had a gap of 3-4 inches from the floor - so not private at all. I say all of this as it was a contrast to the entrance and size of the hotel which is impressive - so clearly we were on the 'cheap' floor, but it wasn't cheap. - Convenient to train line. Looks large and impressive downstairs" .

I think the hotel is intended for short business trips rather than couples on holiday (hence the relatively low price for Tokyo), so this meant we didn't have much room for luggage and the room got a bit cluttered and cramped. Not a huge deal, since we didn't spend much time in the room. The bathroom was also tiny, which made having a shower interesting since the shower kind of flooded the bathroom every time. - Really great location for this hotel - about a minutes walk from a tube station, so easy links to wherever in Tokyo you would want to go. And a great price, considering how expensive Tokyo can be. We also liked the breakfast - nothing fancy, but a good range of Japanese breakfast foods that were interesting to try as a tourist. Staff were friendly, and there was laundry facilities (although only 2 machines)." .

They have complete amenities from the bathroom, toilets, sink, kitchen, and dining room. The only downside perhaps is that there are only two of each on the 2nd floor where I stayed. I did not encounter any problem with using one though because I always use the amenities late at night or very early in the morning. Also, there are no towels but you can rent a large one for 100 yen and a small one for 50 yen. The staff are very accommodating and they don't hesitate to help you when you ask.

There is also a direct train connection to Haneda airport with Akasaka metro line. Moreover, the Ginaz is within in walking distance." .

That's not necessarily bad, but it's part of the charm of a hotel to be greeted by the front desk staff... Great location, but you need to use the metro to get around, which is not covered with the japan rail pass. The closest JR station is Ueno, three metro stops away (170y fare) or a 1000y taxi ride. - excellent bathroom / excellent bed / nice facilities like the nespresso machine / it's quiet / the location is great (senso-ji temple area) / metro stop a block away, supermarket around the corner, lots of eating possibilities (but expensive), great view from the top floor," .

The rooms and bathroom were large and spacious and there are 3 metro stations within walking distance, as well as the Suidobashi JR Station. Of course, Tokyo Dome and its attractions are direct opposite of the hotel too. The drip coffees provided in our rooms were really good!" .

Typical of Japanese hotels the rooms were smaller, so for 8 adults and teens we needed four rooms. But this hotel allowed us a mix of rooms with double beds or two twins. They accommodated our request to for rooms near each other. Staff was super helpful - recommending places to eat, providing umbrellas for a rainy night, best access to subway to the Ginza district, holding bags after checkout while we stayed longer in the area, etc." .

My visits to Tokyo are mainly stopovers for holidays in other parts of Japan. Typically, I would spend the last two nights before I left Japan to return home, in Tokyo so that I can easily travel to the Tokyo Skytree for a meal and some shopping. I could also easily walk to the Tsukiji Market for some shopping too. I have also discovered a little café where I can get a delicious Mont Blanc cake. There is also a great ramen restaurant nearby. Of course, there is FamilyMart within the hotel premises, and this is good especially between September and March when oden is available. It is also very easy and convenient to travel from/to the Haneda International Airport. The hairdressing salon on Level 2 where the hotel’s Front Office is located has been converted to a lounge – On the Street Corner Lounge for the Guest. I was pleasantly surprised that my stay at the hotel qualified me for a “welcome drink” in the lounge and I could have it any time during my stay.

When I pull out the printout to show him what we reserved and number of people checking in, he actually had the nerve to tell me that he is not responsible for type of room given to me by booking.com and since we only have two paid adults, we are only “qualified” for one bed, not two. I pointed out that we selected a specific type/size of room, and paid a premium price accordingly and it was not “given to me by booking.com” and second it is my choice if I can pay for it (if One single person wants to pay for a room with 4 beds for argument’s sake, it’s his or her choice and not based on how many people in the party). After a very persistent request of nearly 10 minutes, we got the room we reserved. And he didn’t give us breakfast coupons that were included in the room rate and needed to be seated at breakfast. We had to go to front desk to request after been blocked at the dining area. That was obviously a very bad first impression from the hotel in terms of customer service. - Location is excellent, a few steps from the metro station. It is an area full of bars and restaurants, karaoke, fun gift shops, good for people seeking good clean fun/nightlife (just be aware of restaurant fine prints, some charge a “table fee” just like night clubs even though you just want to have a normal meal.) very convenient for shopping and going places (4+ subway lines here). Room is small but packed with good amenities, deep bath tub, powerful shower and self cleansing toilet, and plenty of personal toilette supplies beyond typical hotel room supplies (facial cleanser, toner, brush, razor, etc etc). Bed is very clean and comfortable. We got very good night sleep." .

(Think RobotRestaurant, Golden Gai, SEGA arcades, casino slot machines, etc.). Great for walking back home after a night of partying or eating late night. Do not be discouraged by the fact that Kabukicho is technically the \"red light district\", I was here with my wife for 4 days and we never experienced anything you wouldn't see or experience in your typical western metropolis. Be aware though, there is some advertisement and touts for the host or strip clubs in this area, yet I never felt like we were harassed or unsafe. The hotel is also close to Shinjuku or Shin-Okubo station (for JR Pass travelers) 10 minute walk, or the local metro station 3 minute walk. Highly recommend staying in this hotel or area if you are looking to have a fun time." .

Highly recommend the culture lover who stays at here to use and enjoy this bonus benefit. After a nice bath, it would be the best way to relax to have some Japanese rice wine: sake on the ground floor in the hostel's restaurant.

The hotel is beside two train stations, albeit different lines (Suidobashi station and Korukuen Station) and since travelling in Tokyo is all about trains, this is a good spot. The rooms are generally larger than most Tokyo hotel rooms. The bed is super comfortable. Even the bathroom is relatively big. And they give you all the stuff you need like shampoo, shavers, etc. The staff is helpful and friendly, although language may occasionally cause a hiccup.

If you want the luxury of having your room cleaned every day, you have to tell them in advance and pay 2000 yen! (around $20).

He prescribed and provided the necessary medications. The entire process took about 2 hours. Because of the hotel's recommendation, we were able to continue our vacation." .

The AC is pretty strong when it's on, so that's kind of annoying. Even if it was configured to the correct temperature, when it's on, it's on. Given the cozier rooms, the desk is immediately in the path of the AC, so it's really cold there. - The staff at this hotel were fantastic and extremely accommodating for English-only speakers. The hotel also had a coin-operated laundry room which is good. The breakfast (if you choose to add to your stay) is very good and has some variety from day-to-day. There's lots of restaurants and shopping in the area, but without having experience in the Ginza area and rumours of Tokyo being very expensive, we opted for the hotel breakfast instead. The room is a bit smaller for North Americans tastes, but that's how you get the true Japanese experience. Otherwise, it was very clean and had everything you needed. The steel doors with magnet-based signs were a nice touch." .

Extremely tiny room, I know that Tokyo is an expensive city but 100€/night for a corridor shaped room in which you can barely open your luggage without bumping into the bathroom door or side wall, is very expensive. Breakfast quality is goodbut they only have 3 types (European with omelette and a small salad, Japanese with rice and vegetables and Japanese omelette). I've been staying for seven nights and after 4 European breakfasts in a row I just give up and had breakfast outside in a local coffee shop. My advice: don't but breakfast at this hotel if you stay for more than 2 nights. The building is 12 floors with one elevator and no stairs available for customers.

There's a Family Mart convenience store across the road for snacks or basic necessities you've forgotten to pack, and a drugstore for cosmetics and medications (at generally cheaper prices) at the main road junction opposite the train station (both open till late). The NeWoman, Takashimaya and Lumine dept stores nearby offer plenty of shopping and dining options (lots of excellent coffee joints -- Blue Bottle is a must). The rooms (we booked a single and an economy double which are the same size and configuration) are well-maintained and decently-sized for Tokyo standards, with adequate space for luggage and a small closet nook with solid wood hangers. The economy double may be a little tight if you have large luggage (or persons) to accommodate. Room amenities are exactly as described on the hotel website. We appreciated practical little touches like an easy-to-use alarm clock and a vetiver spray mist to freshen our tempura-scented coats. The reception staff spoke English so communication was easy. Baggage storage is available if you plan to travel out of Tokyo, and are returning to the hotel. We would stay here again." .

For example, my wife stepped out of the room alone one night to get some things from the market which is right next door. When she walked back a Japanese guy from the street followed her into the hotel hallway and asked her for... she was extremely freaked out and we informed the hotel staff. Unfortunately the staff were not that sympathetic and did not offer the kind of support needed in that kind of situation. So in terms of location, know what you are getting into. - Location is convenient for Ueno JR station and nightlife. The public bath facilities were excellent with 3 different pools, including a cold pool and a hot bath in the open air of the 12th floor! very nice." .

Location right next to Wanabee gangsters running brothels for Japanese old men. Sick and seedy place. - Four star ??? Joke- so small, couldn't even take anything out of my bag easily: I was in the way ! Rude Japanese people smoking in landing by lift directly infront of camera - 2am talking loudly for over ten mins. Call to front desk did nothing ( non smoking hotel ) smell was also going everywhere. Their noise getting louder. Got dressed , opened the door had no option but to give them an ear bashing. I am just shy of 2 m tall and took the whole door way up. Shouldn't have to get to that...... This is why I pay for 4 star to keep calm and relaxed. Location is good to get anywhere and the park infront was lovely. Brothels whore houses Japanese only BJ bars behind hotel- it was like Kings Cross in London and Sydney/ if I knew I would have picked different area. Hotel is only worth a max of Three Star. So value for money ----- choose somewhere else. Lot of wanna be gangsters in streets behind: who needs it, shame for the girls. Why are many old Japanese business guys so sick and perverts wanting to walk around with girls who look like they are still in puberty ? And their wives tolerate it.... More fool them. Next time you are in Tokyo, keep your eyes open and judge for yourself. Outside Tokyo was truely amazing , with great normal Japanese families and people. Best bits on hotel - room very clean and trust worthy cleaner ( very well done ) plus lots hot water." .

Pay the little extra for a riverside view that comes with tiny balcony too. Breakfast staff were delightful and lovely outlook from room. Japanese and Euro brekkies offered all in room price. Japanese meal beautifully presented. Asakusa is a great spot to stay with heaps of cafes and easy access to Metro for getting around and both airports." .

Stayed there with our tour group- went back to the same place at the end of our trip for 2 nights." .

However, you are using JR Pass . the pass might not be fully ulized as you'll have to pay extra for subway at least one roundtrip every day to connect to JR station . and if you are travel from Tokyo station after a trip from other City < kansai etc. > ther's few train transfer which at some station ( like kudanshita) no elevators available. so quite tiring carrying big luggages . So be well-planed for travelling routes - Clean room, The lounge is always clean and there's bento shop nearby to enjoy The hotel is new and facility still very new .Close to the station just 5 Minutes by walk" .

We mostly used the Daimon station as our starting point for tours and visiting different areas (fish market, Tokyo Tower, Akihabara, Shinjuku etc) As an added advantage, JTB tours picked us up from right in front of the hotel. No navigating through the Tokyo city looking for a pickup location! The staff are really friendly and courteous. They spoke excellent English and were very helpful. The hotel itself runs some classes for tourists such as Origami (thank you Yuka) and painting of maneki-neko (Japanese waving cat). There are heaps of cheap and delicious little restaurants if you head towards the Daimon station." .

Cool!" .

Yes, there was a room card verification at the entrance but it was not needed to swipe on. In the morning service time I noticed some guys, maybe they were hotel guests, or not , entering the public bath without wearing bathing rope. Again, maybe these people were hotel staff or guests, but it is very suspicious to have someone wearing whole pack of clothing and jogging shoes. I have to say it makes me a little uncomfortable to wonder if they were just nearby residents. Through Japan is very safe, it still make me a little bit worried. The other service are very good. I will definitely visit this hotel again. - Good public bath. Great view. The room is very very big." .

Only had BBC - The hotel was centrally located and a short walk to the Railway station. Staff were pleasant. I think the biggest benefit was to have a full use of a mobile phone free of charge during our stay. The provision of complimemtary water bottles was a benefit." .

Restaurants and food everywhere. About 4 mins walk to the subway and Ginza Line." .

It was quite distressing to know their contingency plan was to give me a map of the area with pen markings on nearby parking lots (and many didn't have overnight parking) and then send me off. while waiting for that to happen, I nearly got ticketed right in front of the hotel. I ended up parking at a department store next door, came back finish checking in and off wandering around for vacant parking lots which allowed overnight parking. This took me another hour. I could have as easily stayed at another hotel nearby with proper parking arrangements. I was only tempted to try this because it is newer. I will not go there again. My suggestion is for both the hotel and Booking.com to understand merely stating there is parking available isn't enough for places like Tokyo as many of their parking facilities have height limitation. - location is good. pillows were comfortable." .

In other hotels we used to be offered an earlier check-in , especially that when booking the hotel, we were asked what time we would be arriving. A little bit of flexibility would make the beginning of our stay in Tokyo much easier. The superior queen room with a bigger bed was quite small, which in a way was to be expected, but it was quite difficult to move around as there was no space for suitcases so we ended up putting them under the bed and desk. - Excellent location: a minute walk to Daimon station (2 subway lines) and Hamamatsucho railway station with easy access to Haneda airport via monorail. FamilyMart as well as Seven-Eleven supermarket are also very close to the hotel. There are also many restaurants, bars and cafes. In terms of sightseeing, World Trade Centre building with a great view of Tokyo is nearby (right next to Hamamatsucho station). Entry is 600 yen, much cheaper than Tokyo Skytree, and the view is amazing.

House keeping makes the room for day time with a small table and evening time for the beds. In general, I think the hotel room suits 1 person instead of 3 persons. We have to squeeze in and out to move things. - I like the hotel location. Its close to the Hanzomon station. Its about 5 minutes walk to the station. The staff was polite." .

I'd love the hostel to offer more community events such as bar crawls, etc. - Friendly staff that speaks English fairly well Close (10min by foot) to Akihabara station and hence very well connected with the rest of the metropolis. The side streets towards Akihabara offer a wealth of small restaurants and places to get some food or have a drink with the locals. Cheap and good 24/7 Udon etc. place just across the bridge from the hostel, very much recommended! An ATM is less than 5 minutes away.

The old one, with the elevator right next to the reception desk, is okay, rooms are a little cheaper, but a little smaller and not as comfortable. I know that because I made some confusion in the reservation and ended up staying three days in the new section and two in the old one. No view from any of them. - Very conveniently located, and a very nice staff, don't worry if you don't speak Japanese, everything will be okay. Price, location, and staff are the highest points in my opinion. Plenty of breakfast places at the Ueno station, which is just across the street. There are many restaurants around too, as well as some mini-markets and a couple of department stores with a food market in the basement." .

Note that JR pass is NOT accepted on the Yurikamome Monorail as it’s a different company apparently 😳 - I had prebooked, but unexpectedly at the last minute had issues with my passport. Rather than just take the money and leave me without options the hotel was able to move me to a week after which fitted in to the new schedule. That this is a little out of Tokyo, it would be excellent for kids to have a bit more of a run about. Great shopping location, with English spoken extensively! Finally, a really responsive turnaround from contact on Booking.com to a fast answer!" .

One lady at front desk in particular tried to help me book event ticket at a local convenience store so I really appreciated the effort (even though in the end that didn't quite work out).

In the morning, large groups of people practiced that-chi in the parks and I was lucky enough to watch a spectacular local dance festival there. The nearby Tokyo modern art museum was unfortunately closed during my stay but for me at least, the location and the hotel were perfect and this really enhanced my stay in Tokyo. Very enthused!" .

Inexplicably, the extensive ground floor seating area, which dominates the lobby, is not available for use unless you buy refreshment (which is expensive) and is closed off when the staff have gone home for the night. The result is an unfriendly foyer where there is nowhere to sit other than some very uncomfortable banquettes: weird. The hotel beds were hard and the roll-away bed for our daughter was distinctly old and uncomfortable. We would not stay here again as a family, even given the hotel's good position. - The location is very convenient for the well-connected Shimbashi metro station, which is on several important lines and is also the terminus for the Yurikamome light railway over to Odaiba and all its attractions. This crosses the Rainbow Bridge and is a great ride - especially if you get the front seats in the front carriage. The hotel basement actually has its own underground access to Shimbashi Station (exit D) but in the first instance this is most easily identified from the hotel end rather than coming from the station as the latter has a sprawling layout underground. In the meantime, use exit 7 (Hibiya), which is within 150 yards of the hotel (follow the rail line in the direction of Tokyo Station and you'll find the hotel easily as it's right alongside this). Under the railway arches there are many restaurants and the bright lights of Ginza are only a short walk away. Staff were excellent, as is so often the case in Japan. Airport buses (for both airports) call directly at the hotel and you book your place in advance via the bellhop, who will happily add the fees to your room account." .

Furthermore, we asked for water and were pressed into buying bottles (£6 each for tiny bottles). I discovered the jugs of tap water after the meal. In the end the starters and the water were deducted from the bill. It spoiled the evening though - particularly so as this was a birthday. The other thing was that there was a fire alarm and loud speaker instruction (very loud in fact) straight in to the bedroom telling us that there was a fire on the 4th floor of the annexe. We were on the 33rd floor. We went straight out and met others on the landing. The first fire exit door was locked. This felt to be rather frightening. We finally found another fire exit door and proceeded down the stairs with many others. Eventually it transpired that this had been a false alarm, thankfully. Afterwards we rang to report the locked fire exit but we felt unsure as to whether the report was taken seriously or not. - We loved the view of the Tokyo Tower - both day and night - from our room. The hotel is stylish - there are works of art displayed around the hotel and on a giant video screen spanning several floors. There is a good range of useful toiletries in the bathroom - topped up each morning. The food for dinner is good (we didn't try breakfast). A nice room, comfortable and stylish.

Since it's a budget hotel in Tokyo (one of the most expensive cities in the world), you need to keep in mind that the room will be very small that it is impossible to relax in the room. The neighbourhood is quite ....messy, random, and dirty, but it's 5-10 minutes away the \"good\" city area. - N/A" .

It took more than a few tries for them to know how to enter the details to extract payment. Came across as a little unprofessional. The room was small and the bathroom had a faint, unpleasant smell of urine. That's never acceptable in a hotel of this price range. Ultimately, I found the hotel decent, but too expensive for what I was offered. - Good location, attractive and well maintained front entrance and foyer. Pleasant out-door terrace on the 3rd floor. Convenient room with massage chairs and laundry facilities." .

There was even a fridge and a water cooker and the bed was kind of comfortabel! Slept quite well there and the room where you could leave your stuff was okay. I felt like I had privacy due to the little curtains. And i liked the fact that there was a separate men and women floor. Also the wi fi connection was very good! Also you could get small soaps and shampoo and towel every day very convenient! didnt expect that for the price. The location was also quite near to the city center." .

As I was in a hurry, I refused and was then attended to immediately. - The view from the 12th floor was fantastic.

However when we went to the swimming pool they didn't let us in because we had tattoos, they didn't even let us cover them to go in! I understand Japan has its cultural differences but they should've say that in the website. I've been in some Onsen with tattoos so I know that not all the places have that norm. Plus the sauna is only for men. So if you are a woman and have tattoos avoid this hotel if you want to enjoy the installations. So disappointing! - N/A" .

Ginza is the upscale fun destination in tokyo. -room space is small but enough for TWO people -no wardrobes in the room -10min walking from subway - didnt take breakfast at the hotel - we carried our own museli . not many options around for breakfast in tokyo over all. the Japanese dont enjoy early morning breakfast outside their place perhaps" .

Staff: Even though this hotel has booking.com award, almost none of the personnel knows english. They don't know even basics. Only one of them knows and whenever you have question, they are trying to find that guy. Facilities: In tokyo, you can find free umbrella almost everywhere, markets, metro stations, shops when it is raining, then you return back. But in this hotel when I ask the same question, they ask to charge for 30 usd. - it is a clean and well maintained hotel" .

They take your card on check in, place the charge 'on hold' yet the money still comes out of your account, then when you check out you are expected to pay again instead of just going ahead with the first transaction. All I should have paid was my room service but I ended up paying double and I had to wait days for the money to come back into my bank which really affected me. - Everything was amazing!!" .

My favourite is the dining room with sunken floor style dining table. Staffs are friendly, they could give you recommendations where to eat in the area. They allowed me to left some baggage while I was travelling for Sapporo for 3 days (and return to Anne Hostel afterwards)." .

Walking distance from Sensoij and pier to take ferry to Odaiba and Rainbow River. Breakfast is OK. Courtesy of staff also OK. Across the street from a supermarket. Great view from Tower from the room." .

Except that the furnitures and carpet were in old conditions, the rooms were clean. However, there was a strong smell of cigarette remainded in the semidouble room I lived in the first few nights.. I noticed that the hotel allowed smoking before 1 April 2017 and has become a non smoking hotel since then. The semidouble room had included breakfast.. The breakfast was affluent with all the food one would expect to have for breakfast. It would be convenient for those travel with metro. The metro station is right in the opposite side of the road. You can get there in a few minutes. But if you like JR, you have to take metro to change for it. There are some scenic spots around and you can go there within 20 minutes on foot. Overall, it is a hotel worth the money you paid. I would select it again if the price not goes too high." .

Never got lost as the room came with a mobile phone that is free to use for the duration of your stay. Aforementioned convenience store has cheap selection of super fresh cold food such as sandwiches, sushi, salads, noodles. It also sells ready meals such as gyoza, Japanese curry, noodles, etc, with a microwave behind the counter. Store has international ATM (I used an Australian debit card). The Friendly Airport Limousine Bus from Narita and Haneda airports stops directly at the hotel. If you haven't booked flights, may I suggest flying in and out from Haneda as it's only 20 minutes from the hotel as opposed to Narita which is more than an hour (but still an ok trip). I traveled alone on this particular trip and would not hesitate booking here with family including a nine-year-old. I did not use the pool but it looks lovely in the photos. Don't worry about paying for excess baggage or not having room in your suitcase for gifts- Shinjuku post office is two blocks away (again in a straight line) and is open 24 hours a day. For about AU $80, I posted home about 10 kilos of items I really shouldn't have packed and they arrived at my home in Bondi in THREE DAYS." .

This means that all guests need to crack a window open. The issue with this is that mosquitoes enter the room because the windows do not have screens. I got bit about two dozen times overnight. The following evening, I requested a front desk employee come to see all the mosquitoes I had to kill by swatting them against the ceiling, walls, and even mirrors (photos attached). All she did was provide us with a plug in fan, some bug spray, and some plug in mosquito repeller (that didn’t work). I still got bit overnight. Horrible experience. Additionally, the rooms (although as advertised), were too small for two adults. We reserved a room with a double bed. I suggest that unless you are traveling with just carry on luggages, do not stay here. There is absolutely no space to put a check-in luggage. Much of the room is filled with the bed and a small desk. A small, mosquito-filled room provided for a very unpleasant stay. I highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel during the fall/winter months and/or if you are staying for longer than 4 days hat may require larger luggages that will absolutely not fit in the hotel rooms. - The main reason for flying to Tokyo was to visit Disneyland and Disneysea.

Did the same on the way back. The bus also stops at the Tokyo Station but it's a long walk from the bus stop to Marunouchi line.

PLUS/BEST: there is a money exchange machine in the lobby!!! 1st time I see this in a hotel (and I've traveled a fare bit around the world). The exchange rate was better than that at the mall. So I'd definitely recommend changing your money at this machine. If you haven't at the airport. The exchange rate at the airport was 1€ = 130 YEN; at mall: 1€ = 125 YEN; at hotel machine: 1€ = 129 YEN. It takes Euro notes as small as 5€! SO this is def a big plus point for the hotel. I'm glad I asked the concierge where to exchange money." .

Very near to the metro station, just a couple of minutes walk." .

We were travelling with our 18 month old baby and they provided a crib, blankets, baby tooth brush and even some bunny slippers! There is a 24 hour store just downstairs from which you can buy all your essentials which is great when you wake up at 4am due to jetlag. The restaurants within the hotel are a little expensive but you are right next to two shopping malls with extensive dining options." .

The location was great; the entrance to Shinjuku Station of the Tokyo Subway is right next to the hotel (Exit A1) and the JR Shinjuku station is a short walk away. There's tons to see and do in the area around the hotel; the observatories at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, for example, are a short walk from the hotel.

Seemed to genuinely care if you were enjoying your trip! Speedy and friendly check in, even allowed an early check in which was greatly appreciated. Also upgraded me to a larger room (single bed).

We thought the room just needed to be aired out so we opened the door to the balcony to let some air in. The room itself felt so damp and uneasy. After 30 minutes, we asked to change rooms so they changed us room 1006 (same floor). We entered and the room smell was fine, and everything appeared to be ok, until we opened the bathroom. It had a strong urine odor. We aired it out hoping it would go away. It was already past 930pm and we were exhausted so we just decided to call it a night. My husband had been coughing all night and could barely sleep, so when we woke up, we looked around the room some more and saw that the corner of the ceiling had obvious mold as well as the area around the heater/ac unit, which was right above our heads. My husband isn't really sensitive to things so it must have been really bad for him to react to it. The strong urine odor in the bathroom was still there so we went again to request to change rooms. We took pictures of the mold and changed our room again. At this point, we were ready to book another hotel (we booked for 4 nights) but everything within the area was booked. They changed our room to 608 and one of the staff came with us to inspect it. Everything appeared to be better with this room, but the staff member also noticed the very dirty area around the ac/heater unit. I asked if this was normal in all rooms, she replied yes. We stayed in this room for the rest of our stay and it was fine. The staff here were real helpful with the situation but unfortunately, i dont think we would stay here again. - Close proximity to train station" .

The location has lots of 24/7 convenient stores, nearby restaurants, and coffee shops. Even when we were tired from the sightseeing that we did everyday in nearby cities, at night we find comfort strolling around the safe neighborhood and enjoying the local shops and restaurants. Choosing a hotel, it really depends on your itinerary. Overall, it was an excellent hotel for me and my partner." .

We could only turn it off and there was no way to turn the aircon on for our room ourselves. - Good location, friendly staff who spoke english, room was clean, breakfast buffet had a great variety of western & japanese food. Public bath was well maintained. Bed was really comfortable." .

This is not unique to this hotel in Japan but still a concern when they market a Western as well as Japanese breakfast. The yoghurt and fresh fruit was great though! - Ueno is a great place to stay. LOTS of nice nearby places to eat and shop. The hotel met all criteria regarding comfort, facilities and cleanliness." .

Our floor also had a microwave and vending machine, which was nice. The shower was also much better than I expected." .

The rooms (we had two of them during out stay) were extremely tiny. When you unpack and have the luggage on the floor, there is no room for moving around. It was difficult to manage the temperature in the room with the air con unit. The staff was polite in Japanese style, but their language proficiency varied a lot from very fluent (one young lady in the evening shift) to poor (morning shift). One of the receptionists even used Google translator to communicate. Nevertheless, no issues remained unsolved. Fruit was available for early breakfast goers only. Space was quite limited. - Location in the heart of Kabukicho was good. The walk from the Shinjuku station was not long - when we learnt the route. Dozens of restaurants, shops and services near-by. A large grocery store within two blocks. Umbrellas for lending, extra pillows and pyjamas available, two bottles of water given when you skip the room service. In the breakfast, there were plenty of options ranging from rice and changing warm items to joghurt and cereals. It could have been healthier, but it was okay. Staff greeted every time and was very helpful, even with their limited langauge skills." .

The hotel catering also closes around the same time. But there's family mart right across the road from the hotel which I think close quite late if not 24 hours. - The room is overall clean; bedding and bathing amenities are cleaned and changed daily. The hotel location itself is close to metro and monorail which compensates for its rather secluded location. Additionally, it's close to Haneda airport (approx. 30 mins taking monorail) and big department store Aeon (one station away taking the metro)" .

The hotel was not able to process my Visa card and refused to accept my Visa card twice saying the chip was faulty but it was accepted elsewhere on the same day. Eventually the hotel processed my Visa card payment manually but it was stressful until this was done and it cost me $2386 in my call to my Visa card issuer bank overseas to verify that nothing wrong with my Visa card. - We like the large swimming pool facility which provided lap devider. 30th floor dining room where we had our breakfast had a lovely view over the Rainbow Bridge and harbour view. We had an option to have our breakfast from 3 different rsstaurents available. Bell captain was efficient in handling my baggage for the airport shuttle bus. Dry Sauna room was a bit small but worked very well" .

We were staying for 3 days here and they had my visa card details. I knew that payment was upfront but we couldn't stop by a convenience because we had so much luggage with a tired and hungry baby travelling from Kyoto to Tokyo. My husband had to search for the nearest convenience store atm to sort payment out before we could have a room. Got in the room and there were rubbish left. I didn't realise that this hotel doesn't have a room cleaning service. We had to do the vacuuming it ourselves. Not really something you want to do on a vacation. Also had to ask for fresh towels all the time. The room size is typical for Tokyo hotels, tight, you can barely open your luggage on the floor. - There's a kitchen sink and microwave to heat up your bento. This is the only hotel in Japan out of 6 that I stayed at that did have a microwave. There's a little balcony where you can put extra stuff out like, pram or rubbish bin and also let fresh air in. 8 mins walk to the Ueno station iriyaguchi exit but had to carry the pram as there's no elevator in sight." .

I couldn't fit my suitcase anywhere that didn't involve having to walk over it and there is no closet, so you have to keep your stuff in the suitcase the whole time. There are a few hangers in the entrance, but I could only hang my coat and my suit. There is a washer and dryer in every room, which is free to use, but it's all in Japanese. Also, they don't provide free cleaning service unless your stay is above 6 days, but they change your towels every day. - This is a lovely hotel, in a very convenient position, a couple of minutes from the Suidobashi station and walking distance from Tokyo dome. I liked that they had a full-sized bed, instead of a single bed (I booked a single room), which I had in a previous trip to Japan. Breakfast is also really nice and abundant, I recommend reserving the room+breakfast rate. They have both western-style b-fast (eggs, croissants, pain au chocolate, coffee, etc) and Japanese style breakfast, I enjoyed them both! The hotel does not have a restaurant, so dining there is not an option, but there are several options down the street esp. towards Tokyo dome. The Wi-Fi is free in your room and in the lobby; the bathroom and the shower are very nice, with nice body products. The hotel staff is super friendly though and they kept my suitcase overnight, while I went on a short sightseeing trip." .

The reception area is also set back very far from the street hence contributing to non-visibility. 2. On the morning of my check-out, I noticed that there were remnants of chewing gum stuck to the quilt cover. As it was just a very small patch, I didn't notice it earlier. Housekeeping needs to be more vigilant and with an eye for detail. After all the good work thrown in by other departments, it is a shame that the hotel is \"penalised\" for missing out on something so very important. 3. The hotel should have allocations for a few copies of English newspaper / daily to cater to international guests. 4. There seems to be only 1 lift servicing the entire hotel which could be disastrous if it breaks down. - 1. Location is fantastic if you intend to go for the Tsukiji Fish Market Tuna fish auction / for breakfast. Within 5 - 7 minutes walk from Hatchobori stations (JR / Hibiya Lines), Tsukiji Station (Hibiya Line) n Shintomicho Station (Yurakucho Line). Near to many eateries n convenience stores like 7-11, Family Mart, etc. 2. Staff are very friendly, helpful n cheerful. Really appreciate a young lady Front Office Staff for assisting me on the night of Oct 22 in checking whether the Tuna Fish Auction on Oct. 23 was cancelled due to the Typhoon. She also assisted in providing information on nearby diners for my dinner. Thanks also to the male staff on the \"graveyard\" shift that gave me encouragement to explore getting to the Tsukiji Fish Market Information Centre in the wee hours of Oct 23. 3. Rooms are functional despite being compact, clean (except for a slight glitch) and well designed / decorated. The origami crane on the yukata brought a smile to my face. Thank you. 4. I enquired with one of the young lady Front Office staff on keeping the origami crane as a souvenir when I checked out on Oct. 24 and she promptly gave me an additional 2 more. I was very pleased and thankful for this wonderful gesture." .

It was exactly what I needed, and I'm happy I chose this hostel. The kitchen was spacious and well-equipped, so it was possible to cook my own food. Dorm beds were comfy and the curtains gave them a private feel. There were lots of shower rooms which were very clean. Lounge with sofas was nice as well, although its location right near the entrance/exit made it kind of feel more like a waiting room than a chill-out place. Location just a few steps away from the Yamanote line is decent." .

Modern, clean and quiet hotel that staff were very helpful and polite when required. Hotel provided a mobile phone for your use with free data and calls (international), this was really helpful. Close to some typically Japanese resturants, but not that far from the livelier part of Shinjuku but we didn't venture there as we have a young child." .

I never happened to have a hotel that CHARGE extra money if you arrive earlier for check in and your room is ready! I arrived at the hotel at 1.20pm. Check in time is 3pm. My room was ready. BUT they wanted to charge me 1000yen per hour (total 2000yen!) as per hotel policy. I refused out of principle! It is absolutely RIDICULOUS! If they want to be a \"love hotel\" like many in the area -which charges by hour- they should make it clear!! -They put a kettle in the room. But they don't provide any drink for it. It's obviously too expensive to provide a bag of tea and one of soluble coffee..! -rooms are tiny -I expected that-but clean -no hairdryer in the room! NEVER AGAIN IN THIS HOTEL! - N/A" .

Just ensure you don't arrive too much before the 3pm check-in time as this seems to be strictly adhered to in Japan. If you arrive much earlier there is an option of paying extra to get into the room earlier. - The hotel is minutes walk from Gotanda station with access to trains and the subway. The washer drier in each room is a bonus. Rooms were very clean and well equipped. Black out blinds/curtains very good, very quiet at all times. Left some of our luggage when we went travelling and when we came back we found it placed in our rooms. Lots of good shops nearby. We hope to come back to this hotel in 2020 for the Tokyo Olympics.

The views of the Skytree from the the lobby and open air terrace are spectacular and if it is your first time to Tokyo you get an immediate sense on arrival of the city skyline. We stayed in a twin room and it was spacious, comfortable and impeccably clean. The amenities (ie Nespresso machine, toiletries etc) are all great quality. The area of Asakusa is underrated by tourists it seems as it didn't have the frantic busyness of central Tokyo. The market street in front of the hotel is fantastic for tasting street food, buying souvenirs etc and there are plenty of little restaurants nearby at good prices. One of the highlights of this hotel is its breakfast. They over a good choice of main dishes along with the buffet and the eggs benedict was fantastic.

It is a tray with a small corn soup, cold scramble eggs, 2 small sausages, a petite salad and 1 slice of bread. They do not have milk nor fruits. We did not have the chance to meet any English speaking staff, which was complicated really whenever we needed something. - Located in Shinjuku but not the best area in my opinion… It is almost 10 blocks away from the station and you have to walk or take a taxi, since there is no subway stop closer. Pay attention because there are several APA hotels in the same area, so you might walk in vain for a while finding the right one! If you arrive at the Train Station you need to walk towards the “East Exit”. Exit on the “B 13”. Once you are out walk straight until you hit the big avenue with a boulevard. Crossing this avenue you will see a donuts house “Mister Donut” on a corner diagonal to the Shinjuku Ward Office. You must walk straight down that street (between the donuts house and Ward) for approximately 7 blocks. You will get to another avenue with an APA hotel on the right corner (this is not it). The right APA hotel is on that avenue a few meters to the left. You will recognize it for its restaurant “Very Berry Soup”. Room and toilette are small but 2 persons can manage just fine. Bed and pillows are very comfortable. They offer 1 complimentary small bottle of mineral water daily. And there is an electric kettle with complimentary green tea inside the room. Room amenities, such as shampoo and conditioner, are good!" .

Convenience store in the lobby was useful for cheap dinner or breakfast. The free shuttle to and from Chiba Disneyland was helpful. Solid concrete construction prevents sound/noise transmission between rooms which was excellent! Room service staff is very considerate, they left all our cups with tea/coffee that weren't finished so we could finish them upon return. Room has a modern, light colored theme. Lighting control is excellent. You can turn it all off from your bed. AC works perfect, you just have to know what's written on the remote." .

We are two small adults and we found it claustrophobic, only one of us could sit down on the chair at anyone time. We had a twin room which was more like double bed sawn in half then pushed together. Couldn't walk around the bed at all and no bedside cabinets to put anything on. The room lighting was as bad, no ceiling lights just two spot lights hanging from each side of the room. There wasn't anywhere you could store your suitcases that weren't in the way. Housekeeping is shoddy. Laundry hanging around the corridors all day. We went out all day and came back at 6pm and the room still wasn't cleaned. We did say something but all they could say was We do it now...well no as we are having a lie down now before we go out.Its also not really English speaking..very difficult to make yourself understood. Room size and housekeeping really do let this hotel down especially for a long stay like ourselves 9 days is a long time in a cramped room. Overall it JUST ABOUT DID THE JOB. Room for improvement. - The bathroom was spacious." .

The refrigerator in the room is left empty for personal use. I had the breakfast included in my room and it was good. They give you coupons for it and you can choose between continental (good compared to other Japanese restaurants) Japanese (pretty good) and American (have not tried). The breakfast can also be purchased separately for about 1300 yen in the same “patio” restaurant, or bought outside either at a conveniences store or at a coffee house (there is an ample choice within 5 minutes walking distance. It is attached to the rear of the imperial palace, that is surrounded by a long and very pretty trail, so it’s definitely a great spot for morning strolls or jogs. The subway station is incredibly close (Hanzomon, exit 1-3) even if from the map looks a bit further away, but only because this station has many exits and the one on the map is not the closest one to the hotel.

        hip:hasText  "My wife and i were a bit disappointed on our first night, because the double room that was given to us, was a bit small for a couple. That kind of room (812) is just right for single occupancy. The hotel should inform potential clients that the room or something similar to it, is most suited for a single occupant. Fortunately for us, the hotel staff did its best to find us what turned out to be an ideal hotel room. - The room we transferred to was very comfortable with clean linens and soft, yet neck and shoulder friendly pillows. The cleaning staff is very thorough in its housekeeping. The room is big enough for my wife and I. The front desk staff is one of the most helpful and efficient we have ever encountered. We would like to commend Miss Nao Kato for assisting us beyond what is required of her. The breakfast buffet was also very delicious. Most of all, it has a very strategic location, since it caters to your essential needs if you want to enjoy your vacation. It is beside the subway station and attached to a very big and amply supplied supermarket. Furthermore, it is just a stone's throw away from the solomachi mall and the magnificent skytree Tower. In a nutshell, the hotel offers all the ingredients you need to enjoy your most valued vacation in a city like Tokyo." .

The staff are friendly and very helpful, the hotel is spotless and the buffet breakfast extensive and delicious. The bedroom is on the small side but this is to be expected in Tokyo and more than compensated for by the fact the hotel is in Asakusa and within walking distance of the subway." .

Overall the hotel was great. - The service was fantastic and it was conveniently located next to 3 subway entrances." .

The staff was very polite and helpful. The room included more amenities than I thought I needed, like for example, an universal phone charger (which is important, since the electricity in Japan is different from the one in my country)." .

Can your maps differentiate between the two a bit more? - The bed was restful and rejuvenating, the rooms were tight but somehow everything fit and the desk was convenient, shower/bathroom a bit too tight. We loved the location and views of Tokyo as well as the many shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars as well as of course Sensoji and the Kamnarimon, which we all enjoyed in the few blocks between Asakusa Subway station and the hotel! I've stayed in this area each year since about 2001, and love this location." .

The capsules are also not remotely soundproof so I could hear every other snore and footstep, shutters opening and closing etc. The staff provide free earplugs but these were useless. You must put your bags in a locker on the ground floor, but the capsules themselves are on the 3rd/4th floors and there is no elevator. going back and forth is tiring, because I am reluctant to leave things in my capsule as it doesnt lock (there is a safe, but it is very small). The shower room is also only on the ground floor. I dont know if all capsules are like this but inside the capsules here the ventilation is very poor and the air was extremely dry and made my throat very dry and scratchy. I had to have a water bottle with me because my throat kept becoming parched just by being in there. If I stayed at this place again i might opt for one of the private rooms on the ground floor instead of the capsules, but this makes me reluctant to try capsules ever again, especially because the price was really not that much cheaper compared to budget hotels a little further away. - Very cheap and close to the station. Our main reason for choosing this was to have a cheap place close to Disneyland so that we could get there early without having to wake up too early. (We usually stay at a cheap place in Minami Senjuu but it would have required as to get up really early). Free earplugs available at counter." .

Had a sweeping view of the head of the eight-storey tall Godzilla which menaces the hotel with a display of roaring, flashing eyes and smoke every evening - yes, totally bizarre but exactly the sort of quirk that's right at home in Shunjuku. Excellent location - few minutes walk to the organised mayhem of Shinjuku Station, about a million restaurants within two blocks and the all-important 7-11 up in the bottom of the building. Breakfast buffet OK if unspectacular. Warm, very attentive staff. Only (VERY minor) hiccup was when I asked to borrow scissors to cut a pair of new shoe insoles to size (Tokyo is HELL on your feet). Was advised that I couldn't take the scissors to my room \"because they're a weapon\", so had to do the sizing and trimming in reception, to the very great confusion of other guests :-) Very happy to recommend The Gracery, and would stay there again." .

Long que for brunch. - The hotel is located in the business district of Shinjuku 5 min away from the park by walking. One can go and distress from the busy day there. Very peaceful with a local temple. Although the hotel and the reception area were always packed, express check in and check out service was in place. Thank you Toyoshima for taking care of my request. Really enjoyed the high floor and the view of the city. Thank you Suzuki for helping us with the suitcases and the airport limo shuttle. Loved Zatta lounge NYE's countdown party. It was fun with a great DJ. Superb!" .

Although our floor was no-smoking, at one point someone smoked in one of the rooms and the stink spread to the floor. We informed the reception but, we don’t know for lack of understanding or will, nothing was done. - The hotel is located less than a hundred meters from two different tube stations, which allow to be connected very well with the Tokyo transport system.

The lobby felt quite glamorous and the staff were really friendly and helpful, especially when we needed to leave our bags in the hotel all day after checking out. Our room was cosy, quiet and modern. The bed was ridiculously comfortable with enough space for two adults (my boyfriend is 6 foot tall). Thanks to soundproofed walls and blackout curtains, we slept like logs every night. The bathroom was small but immaculate and had everything we needed, including posh shiseido shampoo/conditioner. Not an speck of grime or grotty grouting to be found. Shower was powerful and water was easy to adjust to the right temperature. The fancy tap and bum-sprayer toilet took a bit of practice, but we were definitely converts by the time we left! The breakfast consisted of a choice of different rice balls (most with fish), plus pickles, miso soup and green tea. We'd never tried a Japanese breakfast before, so this was exciting. In all, APA Kanda Jimbocho was a fab choice for our Tokyo city break. A nice price for a great location and stylish accommodation, without any compromises." .

The staff are friendly, courteous and very helpful if asked for sightseeing or shopping tips. The room was exceptionally clean, bedding comfortable and a good temperature.

We chose the western style breakfast, which isn't as varied as in some countries, and perhaps would have been better if we had selected the Japanese style breakfast, but at the end of our holiday, heading home, we chose to go for more traditional items for us! Highly recommended for a comfortable stay in Tokyo, Shinjuku an easy location to travel around the rest of the city using train system." .

There is even a washing machine that can be used free of charge, and a bar installed in the bathroom useful for hanging up the washing. Well-catered for for those who plan to stay in Tokyo for a week or so to explore the city. Room size was decent (perhaps it may feel small-ish to those who are not familiar with standard Japanese hotel rooms), and despite being situated in a busy area, soundproofing was quite effective. The decent-sized desk with a good chair was excellent for doing some work, while a small corner seating with a coffee table provided a space to sit back for a quiet break. Free coffee in the reception was a bonus." .

A big reason I booked the hotel was the fact booking.com lists an airport shuttle. However upon arrival at 5:50pm we had missed the last bus until another one was to com 5 hours later. I’ve never seen a hotel in all my travels that stops running a shuttle bus during the busiest check in period. Therefore we had to fork out $65 AUD for a taxi instead of waiting close to midnight. The reception played the “no English” card with me when I asked for an explanation. - The hotel has a grand luxurious aura to it but falls flat probably due to cheap ownership." .

There has been at times, many men standing outside together as there are quite a few massage places surrounding the hotel. - Our aircon wasn’t cooling our room sufficiently so we kept our window opened which I would much rather anyway as I prefer natural air to begin with but during the weekends it does get noisy as there are presumably drunk people on the streets. - There is a laundry area that takes 200 yen for the washer and 100 yen for the dryer however there is only 2 of each machine and when we went to wash our clothes only one machine was working. In my opinion 2 machines for all occupants in the hotel would not be enough which is why our clothes were taken out of the dryer before we could get to them and were taken downstairs without our permission, furthermore the clothes were still wet when they were taken out. Which caused a bit of an inconvenience for us as we had to go back downstairs to retrieve our clothes from the front desk and bring it back up to level 7 where the laundry is located to dry our clothes again. - - Staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. They welcomed us warmly and assisted us with our questions. I also needed help with reading and understanding some things and the staff downstairs were exceptional in translating for me. - Hotel is located a short distance from the station, shops and many restaurants. It is in walking distance from shops including daiso and uniqlo, known American franchinses such as Starbucks, MCdonalds and KFC. Very convenient location for everything that would be needed. - The room is of sufficient size with most essentials included. Please note there is no micropwave in the rooms, only a fridge and kettle which we found was enough as we did not spend a lot of time in the hotels during the day and ate out everyday. We left snacks and drinks in the mini fridge provided." .

Slightly annoying is that there is only one lift and no access to the stairwell unless you break an emergency latch. I had to wait a long time for the lift on a few occasions - Conveniently located hotel between Tokyo station and Akihabara. I deliberately wanted to stay somewhere between the two as I would be arriving / departing from the station and wanted to see Akihabara at night. I wasn't disappointed. Also, as a bonus, there are lots of excellent and good value bars and restaurants in the bustling Kanda area only 5-10 minutes walk from here. It is is a comfortable and quiet place to sleep. I couldn't recommend the location more, although don't expect views as it is by a main road." .

We stayed twice in quick succession at this hotel before and after our cruise and both times they did there utmost to have the room ready on are arrival even though it was hours before official check in time. We ate at the restaurants and enjoyed the food and level of service very much. We were very impressed by the whole stay. I say this not lightly we have stayed at many good hotels but I can actually think of no criticisms for this hotel!" .

Well, we can only conclude that these customers never had the chance to experience really know good hotels, otherwise they had been a little more rigorous on their analysis. This is a nice hotel. As a mater of fact, it is the one that presented me with the best offer for the price (85€/night, reserved 6 months on advance, with no breakfast), but, please, be careful, that's it: it's just a nice hotel. - Location: Excellent The washing machine on the superior rooms: Great The views from the room and breakfast room windows: Very good The water pressure: Perfect The electronic toilet: Good idea" .

There's a bus which runs from 4 in the morning and takes 20 mins to get to Haneda. We also really liked the area as it was on the JR line and it felt like quite a local slice of Tokyo life. There was also a fab restaurant around the corner! The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and functional...great value!" .

The heater in the room, also worked intermittently, resulting in me developing a bad cold or bronchitis. It was a bad experience, the 2nd time around. When we requested room 703, she said it was taken. We later found out, from another attendant that it was vacant. It would’ve been nice to satisfy our request, since we were repeat customers.

I was hoping an extension as normally thru booking.com I have 2 hours extension. I called hotel from Narita to request if there is a way for them to assist me in bringing my passport and wallet to Narita as I cannot go back to hotel without missing my flight. No help from the hotel on that matter. Front desk even told me they could not assist in shipping my wallet and passport overseas! No choice but to go back to Hotel, get my wallet and passport but of course I missed my flight! Terrible service for a Japanese brand. - N/A" .

The view was good looking over the imperial palace but I have not idea why half of the windows were frosted bricks? The room was clean and bathroom facilities were good. The locale is great if you want a view of the palace, and there is some good Izakayas and public onsen just down the street. Very close to Hanzomon station." .

Additionally, my bathroom was not entirely clean, hair from the previous visitor were still lying around and on the toilet. NOTE: my other colleagues staying there had no issue, so it is most likely a single case issue. - Comfortable bed, good room temperature for sleeping, and the discretionary bathroom supplies are ideal if after a 12-hour trip you don't feel like opening your suitcase just to freshen up to go for a quick dinner." .

The reception was in the sister hotel across the street (thankfully a very short walk and not raining). The “superior” room was very small with no place to hang up your clothes other than a coat hanger, definitely set up more for a drunk business person for a night than a small family with luggage (where our clothes stayed). The biggest problem was actually with booking.com and their app. This is was the third Tokyo hotel we booked with the app, all of which I selected 2 adults and a child. I assumed I was booking rooms within or beyond those parameters, but no. The first hotel wanted $800 more becuase the booking they received suddenly omitted my 10 year old daughter. My only sane financial option meant a cancellation then a $60 Uber ride to the other side of Tokyo to a different hotel - of whom couldn’t have been nicer and prepared (she even got a goodie bag). Then third hotel, the Centurion, who point blankly refused to even supply bedding for the sofa bed unless we gave them an extra $90. Yep, $90. For a pillow and a blanket. Even when I selected two adults and a child on my room search criteria. Again the hotel said they only received notice for just two adults from booking.com. However the hotel kindly negotiated a discount whilst in the ensuing toing and froing of emails with booking.com themselves amazingly implied it was my fault. Thus I was picking up a feeling from them that they thought I’d deliberately selected only 2 adults to get a cheaper room. However after the nonsense of the 1st hotel I actually double checked my search requirements - I even have a screen grab - but no. Their app screwed up a 2nd time. Having spent the last 23 years in the Service Experince industry, 19 of those actually designing screen based customer touchpoints this has been one of the biggest farces. - The breakfast was above average, though the serving area was pretty cramped to move around when busy - the plants next to the food tables didn’t help. Whilst the buffet was small the food itself wasn’t bad." .

We paid a fortune on NYE to upgrade our two rooms to have lounge access - however we had to queue for almost an hour to get in. The rooms had no complimentary wifi (despite being promised so) and to top off the experience we were not allowed to settle our hotel bill the night before (despite our 5am departure) as apparently this is to prevent loss of the early morning airport bus tickets. Very patronising service. - The beds were very comfortable." .

However, due to the clearing time and the shuttle bus timetable (after 8.45 am the other bus was at 10.55 am), we arrived the hotel around 1 pm. But they charged 50%. That felt me bad. 2. We were to attend the meeting and wanted to have breakfast ASAP but sometimes had to wait (they have seats) for them to clear the tables (not so long time).

If you are over 6 foot 1 then your feet will hang over the end of the bed (this is not uncommon in Japan or anywhere in the world) but for me it did not prevent a good nights sleep. - This hotel really punches above its weight. Cheaper than more starred hotels but in my opinion it has more character and you actually see the hotel staff who are very friendly and helpful...in other more expensive hotels I seldom saw anyone beyond the “automotons” at the front desk. It feels like a luxury hotel because they have focused on getting the important things right. Tip: make sure you look up the walking directions from Shimbashi station to the hotel via the huge underground passage, that way is easy, do not try to find it at street level, even a helpful Japanese commuter with Google maps struggled when he helped me. Excellent food including room service. Very nice rooms. The view to Tokyo Tower (33rd floor) included Mount Fuji on 3 mornings; Tip: wake up at dawn before the cloud covers the top of the mountain.

Sometime you had to run if for 2 cycles (1 hour) even when it was half way dry. I would not recommend doing both washer and dryer option. This left your clothes even more wet. I also thought they should change the breakfast options (at least 2 dishes). We stayed for 6 nights and every morning was the exact same things on the buffet. They should at least have an egg station to order from so you could customize one thing. Other than this, the hotel was excellent. The staff were fantastic and I would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to Asakusa. - The staff at the property were extremely friendly and helpful. I would like to recognize Ms. Takada who assisted us every day with questions on how to get to one site or another through the public transportation system. I also noticed the overall excellent customer service from all staff. When you asked for something, they were very responsive. The staff really made staying at the hotel worthwhile." .

It seems management has trimmed back on all the regular services you would expect for a hotel charging Yen45,000 for a two night stay (no breakfast). - The room size is much bigger than the Tokyo average and that is what attracted me to book it. Very close to Oshiage train station which also has trains to/from Narita airport so it not hard to reach. Also, great supermarket in same building as the hotel, grab your food snack souvenirs there rather than the airport and save $$$. Just across the road and above Oshiage station is a building which has plenty of food options, an interesting Postal Museum, an aquarium, access to the Skytree and when I visited, a robot exhibition. But these \"likes\" are more about the location rather than the hotel itself." .

I had everything I needed during my stay, there was even a microwave on the ground floor and a laundry room at a nearby APA hotel. The hotel staff spoke great English and were always willing to help me with recommendations and greeted me every time I'd enter the building. I highly recommend this place to all people who are looking to visit Tokyo because of its location, it's literally a few minutes walk from 2 stations that can get you to the greatest places. Highly recommended. - N/A" .

As we normally stay in larger hotels we had never experienced anything like this... once we placed our luggage inside our room there was really no spare space. The bathroom was also equally as small if not smaller. The bed took up the majority of the room which meant it was of fair size and actually pretty comfortable. When we originally made our booking we requested a room on a higher floor with a view but unfortunately we were given a room on the 6th floor which backed on to another building so the view out of our main window was very dismal. - The position of the property was perfect! It is only a short stroll to the train station and there are loads of restaurants and eateries in the same street. There was a Tully's Cafe where we were able to get our morning coffee which is less than 50m away and also numerous 7/11's and convenience stores in the same street. The Gyoen Garden is also directly behind the building. We normally stay in the sky scraper district within Shinjuku so it was really nice to be on the other of the tracks for a change. I would highly recommend looking at accommodation in this area. Our room was modern and extremely clean. The room had everything we needed for our stay, this included but was not limited to: slippers, robe, excess pillows, large array of toiletries and sparkling water. Our room was cleaned and all towels and toiletries were replaced daily. Amazing value for money!! We paid less than $150 AUD a night which is relatively cheap by Tokyo standards." .

The staff are very good - my husband left something in our room and the housekeeper contacted us about it and mailed it to us. Advice on airport transfers: the Toei Asakusa line has regular airport express trains between the hotel and Haneda and Narita airports, just check the signs at the metro to see if it is the express. This is the easiest option if you have luggage to deal with as, unlike the monrail, it does not involve a transfer.

We took a tour of Ueno Park years ago with one of their volunteer guides. Great! The transportation options from/to airports is about the best. However if you have a lot of luggage the airport bus may be better and unfortunately the Gate hotel is not a stop for the Airport Limo Bus. - The staff at this hotel is excellent and we felt very comfortable as their guests. This most likely is the case because of the \"right size\" of the hotel. We also had no difficulty communicating with the staff which in many cases is an issue at other Japan hotels. The restaurant is very good and after a few weeks in Japan we were ready for something other then Japanese food. Their dinner menu is not extensive but we found that the chicken is better then anything we have ever had. We had dinner there 2 times but did not take their breakfast.

We really only needed it to crash after our long flight before taking our train ride.The wifi worked good, and it has a beer vending machine on the upper floors, which really comes in handy when you are exhausted, and don't feel like going out. The train stop is walking distance to the hotel, so that was perfect. Tip! The basement of the train station has some great ramen restaurants." .

The breakfast was delicious, just wish they cooked the scrambled eggs a little more instead of leaving them so runny. However, they do have a chef cooking freshly made eggs nearby, so you could always just have him/her scramble you eggs to your exact specifications. In addition, the views are amazing from every room, and the facilities are great. Will definitely go again!" .

Unfortunately the outdoor pool was not in use (it had closed for winter despite the weather being beautiful) and then the staff would only let us use the other facilities (indoor pool and gym) if we paid a fee (approximately £30!). Quite frankly, we found this disgraceful given we were hotel guests, in addition, there wasn't even a reduced fee to compensate for the fact that the outdoor pool (which was the main facility we wanted to take advantage of) was out of use. I have never experienced a hotel which charges its staying guests an additional (and unjustifiably expensive) fee for being able to use its gym and swimming pool (a reason why I didn't check this on its main website). We are very disappointed and it ruined our plans of a relaxing final day in Tokyo. - N/A" .

Also, given how well everything else seemed to be set up, it would have been great to have gone that one step further and had a television which enabled iPhones to be paired with it for viewing on that large screen. - The room was very user-friendly - a charger was set up and ready for phones and there was a nice desk for working at if necessary. The limited space was made good use of and the overall feel was modern and stylish. The free shuttle bus to Haneda Airport provided the smooth and efficient access we needed." .

You won't get anything unique by staying here, but if that's not an issue for you, then they're definitely a reliable option. This particular APA is in North Ikebukuro. The location itself is generally lower cost and convenient for travel and site-seeing, and has a lot of restaurant/bar options, BUT Ikebukuro itself isn't anything special.

I know I shouldn't take it to heart, but this man was rude. He spoke to me in a harsh and loud voice (no, I am not deaf!) on the two occasions that I had the misfortune to be subjected to him. For instance, he snapped at me when I cheerfully asked how to say in Japanese that my suitcases contained fragile items. He said that it didn't matter as they would just throw the cases into the bus without taking care (this was not true - and disprespectful to the Limousine staff who are very service-minded and friendly). Further, he snapped and was rude when I went to board the bus. Japanese hotel staff are kind, helpful and obliging. So, this is at total odds with every other stay in Japan over 30 years. Again - I should not let one offensive person ruin my opinion of the hotel. However the meetings with him followed me home and not in a pleasant way. He is clearly unhappy where he is and should not work in an occupation dealing with the public. The hotel should either put him in the back office or at least teach him how to behave nicely to guests. - Clean, quiet and despite well-planned room for the size. The room was small and suitable only for one person. There was only a small area to put coats/shoes and only room for one large suitcase. Desk. Several mirrors. Well-equipped bathroom. The room was cool (i.e. not too hot to sleep in) and there was a cotton night gown (changed every day) and slippers. Fast, efficient lifts. Free Japanese and English papers. Location is excellent; five minutes walk from Shinjuku station and restaurant area. There is a post office across the road and several vending machines.

Good japanese breakfast. DO NOT MISS an evening in their (small) restaurant (Mon-Fr): high-grade local cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere, broad selection of sake being served chilled and hot (try the fruity one from the blue bottle...)" .

Very convenient for the monorail to Haneda (especially if you need to travel during rush hour), with a metro stop (Rinkai line) essentially in the same building." .

They also charged us an extra 3 drinks to the room on our checkout bill; my partner & I had a cappuccino each in the restaurant on one of the days & put it on the room tab, the receipt (which we were not given on the day of purchase) was for 2 cappuccinos & 3drinks, in which they could not confirm what the drinks actually were. At this point we were running out of time to make our flight, 3 staff members were involved & the complication was not even nearing resolution so we just payed it. No complimentary water or tea/coffee sachets for the rooms. - Fresh, plentiful buffet breakfast offering traditional Japanese & Western style." .

It took us a little effort though to find the hotel walking from the Suidobashi station where we arrived from Tokyo station by JR rail (with one easy change) even though the hotel was really close to the station. Print a street map and bring it with you if you can. They also have a detailed maps at the train station and on the street which helped us a lot. It is pretty easy to get to the hotel by the JR from and to Tokyo station. And from Tokyo station you can walk to the Imperial Palace East Gardens. From there we took a metro back to the hotel which was a really close distance but took us a while to figure out the transfers... - Super comfortable and very modern spacious room. Has great kitchen, super modern bathroom and fast washing machine. Very nice buffet style breakfast was a really good value. Nice friendly staff, answered all our questions and ordered us a taxi to HND airport on a short notice (cost ~80 USD for 20 min ride - but helped us a lot as we were really tired after the intense morning sightseeing walk and had a couple suitcases, so the metro ride to the Haneda airport with 3 transfers didn't look very appealing). Overall it was a very pleasant stay. Many restaurants and convenience stores with ATM machines around... Thank you!" .

Went instead to the check out counter to inform them that we need help for our luggages since we have plenty of bags to carry down to the 1st floor and told her that we don't want the lady in their concierge to do it for us since she's quite upset and had an attitude problem.

If you get the cheapest room when the hotel is full, you might feel a little bit cramped (we've stayed five or six times at the hotel so know what to expect). Location is great if you want to be in Asakusa, but Tokyo is huge and Asakusa is far from most other parts of the city, so just be aware of that. - Amazing breakfast---best (Western) breakfast in Japan? Stunningly good, buffet with fresh-squeezed orange juice and great croissants, and a single made-to-order dish. Amazing value. The rooftop bar (guests only) is a true gem, views of the Tokyo Skytree. Value for money is amazing if you get one of their deals (or cheap rooms). On this trip we got one of the cheap rooms and were upgraded for free to one of their best rooms, view of Skytree from the bathtub! Wow! Direct train (Asakusa line) to Narita and Haneda. About an hour to Narita. Tokyo Metro connections good (Ginza line). This hotel is a true gem, even for Japan. I almost hesitate to submit the review because I don't want too many other people to find out!" .

How nice! Big private locker-room for my suitcase etc. Nice, clean capsule, which actually doesnt look like capsule but a bunk bed surrounded with walls Big shelf and a curtain inside of the capsule- really it feels like you have your own room Facilities looked new and tidy, no noise or other trouble Private bathroom for woman, with many spacious cabins, including ones with a bath. If for some reason you're super worried about a male intruder, rest assured- there is a separate floor for women, you also have to scan your card to enter the capsule room and the bathroom- super secure ;) Finally, simple yet ingenious- they put those cards in a pouch you can hang on your neck- seems like nothing, but if you loose small objects a lot like me, it actually helps a lot. 12a.m. check out time- sweet heavens, is this real? they have a lift- not as common in cheap hostels as one could think" .

I like the memory foam type, so I was really happy it was available. I also enjoyed having clean, crisply pressed nightwear every night.

This helped me and my nephew feel a lot more comfortable being in a foreign land knowing that I could ask questions about the area in English.
