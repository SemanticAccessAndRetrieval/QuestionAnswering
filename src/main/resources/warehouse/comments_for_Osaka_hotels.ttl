Blue line train (Yotsubashi Line) was the closest. Red line train (Midōsuji Line) was the furthest (around 10mins to reach exits 25/26). Not an issue for us with teenage kids but the long walk can be a challenge to others. - 1. Room was clean and well lit. 2. Good food and convenience stores within 3 mins from hotel." .

Room was stuffy & warm, temperature was central control, no ventilation, windows were locked. One switch to control room lights, choice of either groping in the dark or waking up your partner. Only 1 power point by the bed, took forever for 2 phones on a multi plug to get charged. Free Wifi was not stable. And they won’t help to book USJ when I had trouble booking online. - Direct access to train stations but madness too because too many exits, ended up lost in the maze. Lots of eateries & many open till late. A senior Mr Shigeta was very helpful with information to the Science Museum & travelling around the city." .

B1/B2 (just forgot) exit is just a few steps from one of the subway station exit though the hotel website does not mention it, which I think is an important information for the traveller. - The location is really excellent, just located at the centre of many shopping attractions and subway stations. The staff is nice, helpful and can speak English. My room's toliet ventilation fan was not working but was fixed very quickly." .

Otherwise, all good. - The location of the hotel was excellent, above Nankai station and an apartment store. If you are going to Osaka for a shopping trip, it would be one of the best places to stay as you can simply walk from the hotel to Shinsaibashi, Senichimae, underground shopping street etc in 5 minutes. We checked in at around 4pm and the room type we originally booked for was already full, so we had a free upgrade on the higher floor. Great view if you booked for higher floors. Met a few staff on the way to the room and all were super nice and eager to help. I am a bit of a neat freak yet 9.5/10 for the cleanliness!(< room was a bit dim so cannot comment on the carpet condition, which was presumably alright). Amenities were well-prepared like most of the standard Japan hotels so don't worry if you forgot shampoo/conditioner/shower/brushes/toothbrush/etc. Love the water pressure especially after you took a long walk at the city center." .

They also advertised first drink 50% off but they did not honor this as the staff didn't seem to know about it. I even showed the staff website on our departure and they still did not correct.

So make sure with hotel before your arrival date because it is absolutely too narrow for 2 beds in Single room/ 3 beds in Twin room. We can't even open our luggage. - The hotel is located not far from train station and restaurants so it is very convenient for tourists. Rooms are clean and well equipped." .

I was only staying one night, I would have had to have written it as soon as I arrived! Also, surely people are more inclined to leave positive reviews since they are being bribed? If the place has the capacity to give towels to guests they should just do it and good reviews will follow if deserved. The showers and taps do not stay on - they turn off after a certain time. This means in the shower you are constantly turning it back on. I understand this reduces water usage, which is a good thing, but it doesn't make for an enjoyable shower! Our private room didn't have any windows which was a bit odd but we slept well. A little pricey for a hostel but we did have a private room and the location is good. - Location was good - walkable distance to JR Namba and lively area of Dotonburi on the doorstep. The hostel had a decent kitchen by the looks of things but we didn't make use if it. There were a good number of clean, hot showers and hairdryers available. WiFi was good and our private room had AC." .

It's probably a good idea to bring foldable hangers if staying in this hotel. We used the chair for one of our luggages and the shelves for cups and glasses for some of our clothes. Other amenities include: two pairs of slippers, electric water kettle, hairdryer, flat screen TV, mini-fridge, and safe. The room had a modular bathroom (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Minimal_Toilet_Shower_Bath_module_in_the_Japanese_hotel_room.jpg). I'm 5'5\" and when I'm taking a shower, I would occasionally hit the ceiling with my elbow as I try to shampoo my hair or rinse the soap suds off. Needless to say, anyone taller than 5'5\" will feel a bit cramped in the bathroom. The provided toilettries are adequate: toothbrush with toothpaste, cotton buds, hairbrush, and body scrub. The body wash is Savon D'or by Shiseido, and the shampoo and conditioner are Tsubaki. Can't say much about these products but they got me clean and smelling fresh. There was no flat iron in the room (maybe to prevent accidents?) but there is a coin-operated washer/dryer on the 12th floor. - The hotel Is very near Shinsaibashi Station. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes if you take to #7 or #8 (Hotel Nikko) exit/entrance. It's about 10 minutes to Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street and 15 minutes to Dotonbori. There are a couple of restaurants and coffee shops near the hotel. We got to try the kushikatsu place less than 15 meters away. It was pretty good. Smoking is allowed in the restaurant though. If you haven't tried Japanese pancakes before, I suggest you try Elk. You can't miss it. It's right beside the hotel. There's also a coffee shop next to the hotel but we never got to try it out. At the restaurant, guests are provided with free water, juice, tea and coffee 24 hours a day, as well as complimentary ramen and alcoholic beverages (beer, spirits, sake) every night between 10pm to 11pm. There are massage chairs in the lobby and are free to use by guests. It's a big hit for visitors especially after spending the entire day of touring Osaka. Oh, and there's free Wi-Fi. The staff are friendly, helpful and accommodating. The hotel is clean as well as the room we stayed in. The hotel has a lavatory near the lobby that has the welcoming feel that only a Japanese lavatory can provide." .

Yes it's cheap but it is filthy, dirty sheets not cleaned from last person, floor filthy, shower smelt like a public toilet (didn't want to use it) and toilet floor layered with wallpaper that is also filthy. Went into one room when looking for shower and flys flew out. The wiring is so dodgy and exposed everywhere, even a wire hanging out of the ceiling over the bed. This has clearly been a DIY project for the owner but it's not fit for purpose. I can't even go into everything as too much stuff to mention. Including gaps in doors so anyone can look into room or toilet. Not to mention security, doors locked first night to public but second night open all day so anyone could come up into rooms and if wanted could just kick the lightweight DIY door down and get your stuff. Also owner leaves keys on check in desk for people to check in so anyone off the street could get into room area anyway! Yes it's in a good location but we didn't stay one night and checked into cheap 'love hotel' which was only £20 more than this dump and it had an outdoor jacuzzi and was clean haha and only a 5 minute walk I to the centre. Osaka has many love Hotels that you can stay overnight at and are very cheap and in good locations. Go for this option instead, we wish we had! - Location is good but plenty other good places to stay where you don't have to sleep in dirty bed sheets from last person" .

I stayed at 3 of these Mitsui hotels in my 2 weeks in Japan and each had no flexibility for the check-out time (fair enough I guess, but I've never had this with other 4/5* hotel chains). I paid for additional 2 hours at an earlier Mitsui hotel, but it made me feel rushed and on the stopwatch. This was my last stop in Japan with an evening flight, and although they stored our luggage, access to a shower would have been helpful. The breakfast was rushed and overcrowded. Nothing wrong with the content, but a little narrow and awkward for the families. Maybe perfect for Theatre or Business stay, but it will never be a 9 or 10 for me. - It was very clean and great for access to Metro station. Its a business/bank district so very quiet and safe in evenings. Trendy bars/cafes and theatre and on the river so nice for an evening stroll." .

However, it was a good price and in a good area. - The staff are very welcoming and helpful. I left a bag on the subway and the staff were very helpful in calling the subway stations to help me find it again. The location is also great, lots of fantastic local restaurants nearby.

It's in a great location near downtown Osaka and near hommachi station. Also, if you don't feel like finding somewhere to eat - the hostel makes great breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I personally recommend the fried chicken. The maple French toast is also a delicious breakfast treat! They are also renowned for their takoyaki and let me cook some in their kitchen - was awesome! All of the staff here are so wonderful and friendly. Most of them speak English and all of them know how to have a good time!! From late night chats in the bar to Karaoke until 4 in the morning! If you want to stay somewhere warm, modern, with heaps of character - you must stay here!! Thanks for my birthday cake guys, don't forget to change your menu from 'Launch' to 'Lunch'. Or just leave it like that because it's hilarious!!" .

I'm traveling. I'm not checking email. This is quite impossible. It is far from the JR station. There are so many Umeda stations in the area.

They both come with two full beds that allow up to 4 guests to a room. Since we were a party of 5 we split the group in two and allow it so no one but my husband and I had to share a bed. When upon arrival they were confused saying i booked for 4 not 5... which is not true. Regardless I'm paying for two rooms that technically allow up to 8 people. They called booking and they said with the room selection I didn't change the amount of people. But they showed that I had selected for 5. I've never had to alter the amount of people to each room for a booking before. Nor did I see this as an option. I actually just went back on to do another booking with the same hotel and like all their bookings it's by room rate not by individual. This isn't a hostel btw. So they said I'm being charged for an extra person which was roughly another $170. Since I've stayed there before and knew this was not right. I'm not happy with how booking.com handled this with the hotel. In years of booking with them I've never ran into a problem where booking 5 people suddenly gets changed when having to select multiple rooms. I looked for the allowed amount of people and since when do they change the room rate based on how many?!? So using that logic... if I book a room that allows up to 4 but only have 3, do I get a discount? Of course not! I'm extremely displeased with how they talked to me on the phone and made it sound like this was common practice and it was my error. Since I don't see a place where to call also I love Japan so customer service lines I usually can't call. I'm leaving this here. - I have stayed here twice now and I love the hotel.

I was travelling with my 2 friends, so it's 3 of us. When i booked it for Oct 2 - 3, 2017, i couldn't find the room for 3 persons, so i booked a room for 2 persons and hope that i can upgrade it with extra bed. But The fact is the room is really small, so i decided to upgrade the room for 3 persons. The next day, when we back to hotel in the evening, the reception at the front desk asked us for the bfast menu, and when i back to my room, she said angrily to my friend who still in the downstairs and said that she saw it's 3 of us but we booked a room for 2 persons,, so she asked my friend that one of us has to leave the room, otherwise she would call the police !! When i talked and explained to her, she started to checked my reservation and surprised when she knew that i have paid the bill from the 1st day and it's for 3 persons!! What a rude attitude!!! - N/A" .

The design of the bed position is bad, as there is a hard concrete shelf just behind the bed and when you try to lie down onto your pillows it's very easy for you to bang your head onto that hard concrete edge, which happened to me and my partner. Also most of the staff don't speak English. However there is one lady at the front desk that speak perfect English, almost native speaker level. - The location is superb. It's within walking distance from JR, Hanshin, Nankai, and all those subway lines. There is a big supermarket at the JR station about 50 meters away from the hotel and the dotonbori is just 500 meters away. If you plan to visit Kaisai area and plan to use JR pass, this is the perfect spot to stay. The room is huge by Japanese standards. The rooms include all the toiletries you want, and then some more. The hair drier in the shape of a comb is really good if you have lots of hair." .

There were two loveseat couches, a table, AND a king-sized bed in one room - and there was still room to spare! It was also just really cool-looking.

Hotel staff was very helpful and proactive in solving an issue with the booking and in general they were very kind. Room was very spacious for Japanese standards and with good facilities. Internet connection was good and stable" .

Then, the day before the day before, put down the packing of the garbage to the second day at noon, and no one was cleaned up. It is not my intention to pick the same price at the same price in the namba holidayhotel, the feeling is completely different, their home room is complete, the service is better.

We had to pay every day to take the subway to a different station. - The location can't be beat! It's right in Dotonbori, a short walk to restaurants and shops galore! There's also a train station not too far away (although if you're coming in with a lot of luggage in the evening, it might be difficult to get through all the people). Despite all the street traffic outside, we never heard anything from our room." .

In fact, most of them were sold out so this was the only available option for my price range, so I happily made the reservation." .

It is part of Nankia-Namba Station complex with direct connection to scores of shops and restaurants as well as rail (not JR) and subway lines. Also connected to Takashimaya Department store for high-end shopping and great restaurants on top two floors. They even had a free jazz concert in the lobby on Sunday afternoon featuring gypsy and traditional (from Denmark, no less) jazz groups. I was first led to believe this hotel was prohibitively expensive but turned out to be quite reasonable when booked through this site. The staff even arranged a room upgrade for us as we decided to stay two nights. I highly recommend Swissotel Nankia Osaka." .

Our bed was a double and it had two single mattresses crammed in, overlapping each other in the middle so there was a big lump then sticking out on all sides up over the frame so it bowed from the outside in. Super uncomfortable odd pillows. All the wires are outside the walls I didn't trust it so didn't charge my devices. There was a 2cm gap right around my door so I could see people through it and hear everything from my floor and the floor above and below and the entire staircase. Floors super squeaky, walls paper thin. Woken up every 30 minutes by anyone coming or going or using the toilet across from me or talking anywhere on my floor. I could literally hear everyone doing their business in the toilet. The guy at reception tried to short change me while simultaneously complaining that I got the room too cheap. This place was built by someone with no building experience whatsoever. I never review places but I had to this time it was unbelievably bad.

        hip:hasText  "All great - We were not too sure about booking a \"love\" hotel, but after reading other reviews and being a bit tired of the small rooms/small beds in typical business hotels, we thought \"why not\"! Although check-in is not until 5pm, we knew we would be arriving into the evening so this was not an issue. We arrived into Shin-Osaka by bullet train and it was so easy to connect to the subway line - go one stop - and then it was about a 10 minute walk. Although it was a bit limited for places to eat nearby, there was an excellent supermarket between the station and the hotel so you could easily grab a meal here if you didn't want to go too far for food. Check in was smooth & very friendly...and the room! We had room to spare! The bed was the comfiest of any we had during our 3 weeks in Japan. We had a nice sitting area where we could relax, large entry area for bags...did we say we had lots of room??!! And the bathroom was fabulous - it had everything you could need and more. Lovely lotions, hair products...and a separate big bath/shower wet room. The staff were very clear that check out was strictly 10am which was fine. Yes, its a bit off the main hub but for the price, we had so much comfort and so much space and it was amazing value. 2 nights here cost us about the same as 1 night in a tiny room in a business hotel at Shin-Osaka station...and we were only one subway stop away. The same subway line goes straight to Umeda (hello shopping) and Namba (hello Dotonbori). You can get an all day subway ticket to get around Osaka - great value. If it helps anyone arriving into Shin-Osaka, its one stop to Higashimikuni station (on the red line) and use Exit 1. Then walk maybe 10 - 15 minutes...follow the subway line & head north. You can't miss this great hotel that looks like a zebra! Great stay...if we return to Osaka, we would stay here again" .

Since my husband has severe back problem, he asked if she could find someone else to help with the wheelchair, one big suite case, and a box of product samples. She said there was no others available and in stead, she asked my husband to lift the wheelchair and suite case because they were too heavy for her! (even after my husband told her he had lower back problem). I joined my sister later that day and stayed at Hyatt Osaka for 2 nights. On the second day, we left for the food show near the hotel around 10am. When we came back at 3pm, room was not cleaned at all. After I talked to the housekeeping staff, she politely apologized and started cleaning the bathroom while we were there. At the end, she asked if we could go out for a while so she could make beds and vacuum the floor. We were too exhausted to go out again so just asked her to leave. I don't the rules of housekeeping but next time I probably should tell the front desk the time I am coming back. - Great breakfast!!!" .

For the same price you can get much better. It wasn't clean, especially the weird small carpets on the floor. I'm not picky at all with guesthouses when I travel but this place was just a mess and the \"secret\" fee was a deal breaker to me. The shower clogged for no reason and it was complicated to make it work. The staff barely talked to us and they were hard to contact in the evening. I don't recommend this place. Take the price they're announcing, add 3000 yens, and now look for a place that charges that total price and you'll get much better ! The only situation in which I believe it would be worth it for the price, is if you stay for a long time, since the 3000 extra yens is a cleaning fee per stay.

We see several public parking lot mentioned 24 hours. But in fact it means that specific rate is up to midnight. So be careful to read the sign before you get in. Or else when you go pick up your car in the morning, you would see the bill comes out with a totally different parking fee. We circled around to find another parking lot that's about 8 mins walk to the hotel. Other than the ground floor has refurbished, the rest of the building is not. But that's okay with us, the beds are clean, just the bathroom looks a little old. - The family room is very spacious. We were actually quite surprise to see the room comes with kitchen with all the stuff you need. Chopping board, pot and pans etc. And we like the room that has a big dinning table. We end up bought fresh food from the AEON supermarket and cook for the night. The laundry room is just right across the front desk. I haven't seen such a big laundry room in the other Japanese hotel i stayed during my trip. The laundry room has a bookshelf that also keeps many tourist maps and guidebooks for review." .

The room can sleep only 1 person although the room has 3 beds (why would 1 person needs 3 bed in 1 room?? it is still a mystery I couldnt find the answer until now l) so the front desk rudely asked for more money since there were 2 adults and 2 kids in our party. Luckily we went to the internet and got a cheaper rate than what the front desk Iwamoto (their chief ??) quoted us to pay more!! So, we rebooked the room again using booking.com with the new rate. They didnt give us the room until almost checking time, we arrived around 11 am. I accidently checked Agoda.jp while waiting in Starbucks near by the hotel and for 2 adults and 2 kids was about 8k yen cheaper than the rate booking.com we just paid (include breakfast). Oh welll we were too tired to argue, but we should have. Didnt know that booking.com has a guarantee that they would have matched the price. Should have booked agoda.jp at that time too although we already signed everything with booking.com and gave our credit card to the hotel front desk and waiting for the key and asked booking.com to cancel. Not sure how booking.com would handle it, but we would have saved us some money!! - Location" .

        hip:hasText  "The breakfast is very expensive. There are lots to eat downstairs so I would not recommend breakfast. Getting extra towels from reception is very tricky, you need to really insist. There is a nice little church just behind the lobby at the 22nd floor - it’s like a building within a building. It’s used for wedding ceremonies. Years ago when I first stayed here, the staff had no problems allowing me inside for a peep. Currently it’s under lock and key and closely guarded as if the Royal Jewels were kept there. Hotel staff gets expressly nervous and edgy if you happen to get anywhere near. Maybe Aliens do exist and live inside and they don’t want the secret to be out. If not, I do hope they try to be generous with the place. - This is a mid-to-upper level hotel but the Monterey name is synonymous with Class and a minimum guaranteed level of comfort and quality. I should know well having stayed in this particular one for the sixth time and it’s Tokyo Ginza sister hotel twice. The Classical English deco is maintained the same within the chain. So is the standard of comfort and cleanliness. The rooms are slightly bigger than the average Japanese hotel in a prime location. The beds are a little bigger too. I asked for a twin room and each of the beds were large enough to squeeze an adult and one child. Service at the lobby reception used to be extremely impressive. 5 years ago I left my back pack on a coach bus while getting from the airport to the hotel and somebody from the reception spent almost 40 minutes helping me to make calls to track, trace and retrieve my baggage. When it finally arrived, it was wrapped so nicely as if a x’mas present from Santa. Currently, my feelings are that the staff from reception looked tired and worn out. When I called them to ask for extra towels, there was a big hassle like they were going to loose money if they had obliged. But there was absolutely no problems getting the towels when I spoke to housekeeping directly. Could be a case of approaching the right people for the right stuff. Therefore the quality of service is not uniformed for all staff. Location is everything for this hotel and I stay because of the location. Namba is iconic of Osaka. It is famous for shopping and shopping can be done just across the road. There is a huge supermarket directly beneath. The Kintetsu Train Line heading straight for Nara is also downstairs. Most importantly, the OCAT bus terminal is just beside the hotel. You can get to and from the airport by coach via OCAT. If you have lots of luggage and plan to go Kyoto as your next stop, taking JR at Umeda would be extremely troublesome and OCAT beside this hotel would become a very good alternative." .

You put your suitcase on the floor and you have to jump over it, because there is no space. The room is only the size of the bed + half a meter wide passage. Small table with a tiny chair. Don't go there if you are a bad sleeper: it is quite noisy from the street and the fridge in the room is noisy. Also there is lots of light from the street, I had to sleep in my airplane sleeping mask, because for me it was not dark enough. In the kitchen there is a sign on one of the taps that it is drinking water, I drank from it until next day I filled my water bottle and saw that the water is grey colour. Not super easy to find when you just arrive, but the officer of the subway station has maps with all the nearest hotels and gives them to you and explains if you ask. Don't hope to use aircon all the time in a single room: it is right over your bed and blows right onto you and if you use it at low speed it starts to slightly smell. I found that the comfortable way to use it is switch it on for 5-10 minutes, then off again. And at night I had to open the window instead. If you walk at night from the JR station (Shin-Imamiya) there are lots of homeless people, so you either don't cross the road right near station and cross it later, or better use the subway at night (Dobutsuen-mae) - none of them were offensive though, just unpleasant and smelly :) Occasionally homeless people passed near the hotel in the evenings too, but not too often. In total: incredibly cheap accommodation for a superb location in the city center, with some downsides - definitely worth the price. - The location is just superb. Close to the subway and JR, so I was able to travel easily to all the tourist destinations + you don't have to pay twice if you only need the JR or only the subway. It is also close to the active trading and cafe area where there are lots of options for food until late at night, close to the \"Spa World\" - a great place to spend half a day if the weather is not good for sightseeing. I really appreciated fridge in the room. Free coffee was available in the lobby in the mornings. I did not prebook female floor, but was accommodated there and I think that was nice, quiet and clean. Super friendly staff and speak English well. Facilities were relatively clean, but not sparkling. Some reviewers complain that the showers are always occupied, I did not have this problem. There are 4 showers, I always found some of them empty, every day (I took shower in between 18-19.00)." .

Staff did not help for early check in even though it seemed that the hotel was low occupancy. Staff was fairly polite though. I guess they're strict on check in time. Lobby light was off when we got back around 11pm. Not very secure hotel, door passcodes were written on wall. Guests should be informed at check in. Felt like a service apartment or motel really. Corridors were open air in the freezing cold. Best of all, no lift in the building so we must drag up 2 20kg heavy bags up the stairs. Pity the family next door who had to drag their pram and small kids down the stairs. No shelves or cupboards in the room to keep items at all. Only a small hanging space next to the bed. - Location was very near to USJ, room was small but clean. Toilet was v huge for Japanese standards. And had seperate bath and toilet areas. Kitchen was complete with stove, sink, fridge and microwave but didn't have time to use." .

At night a cockroach appeared under the bed, my japanase friend complaint in the morning at the reception (in japanese), no refund was given and the people at the reception were not even able to cancel the night for the next day. We actually were leaving the hotel earlier than planned. The woman at the reception was unable to handle the complaint professional and to make decissions on her own even after discussion with their coworker. Customer Service and Customer Orientation means to me something different and I will therfore not recommend to stay there any single night. The price / value was the worst I have ever experienced not only in Japan and the room was dirty not to mention the cockroach. Usually I don`t give bad recommendations but this hotel did really upset me. Even had to pay the rate for the full night of the next day according my contract but we left this hotel in the morning. The receptionist told us to write some formal complaint to the hotel management which I wonder why they haven`t just forwarded this complaint. I will stay in this area again in the future but definetly not in this hotel anymore. - The location was alright" .

But I won't recommend you to go to the south side of the hotel, you will find an impoverished neighborhoods with dodgy people walking on the street. I saw one guy eating chicken nuggets from the trash bin in nearby convenience store... Check-in process wasn't very smooth as I had to pay via machine, and the staff asked me to go back to the front desk to fill in registration form. I could feel they try to trim every penny from their service to offer rooms cheaply. Although the hotel uses Simmons bed for the comfort of guests, I had hard time sleeping as it was a little hard for me. Sleeping there wasn't pleasant for me. Everyone has different preference so those who prefer harder beds may not have any problems sleeping. Breakfast is only 800 yen but you only get what you pay for. There isn't much selection. Mostly Japanese options. I don't recommend hotel guests to choose breakfast. - The front desk staff looks all Japanese but some of them can speak Chinese, Korean, or English. 50% of hotel guests are foreingers so they can get help in your language. As the hotel is newly built, it is very clean. The room is slightly bigger than hotels in Namba/Shinsaibashi area. The bathroom is spacious. This hotel is a value-for-money option. As the company's main business is real estate, I reckon they can provide rooms at very reasonable prices." .

Cheaper food options are available at a 7-11 (open from 4am to 1am) just 1 minute away in the station that is huge and sells many souvenirs for last minute shopping. If you are a fan of Hello Kitty or Peanuts, there are Japan-themed souvenirs in the 7-11! While walking to the Umeda line outside, you will pass a Pablo store selling the famous Osaka cheese tarts. The dining level (I think...14F?) offers many options. We had amazing katsu from KYK - if you have the Osaka amazing pass, it offers a discount on your bill. Check out Eki Marche, the entrance is super close to the hotel in the station (when you exit the lobby, turn left and walk straight until you see the sign Eki Marche on your left). Eki Marche has a Don Quijote, which sells a ton of interesting snacks and souvenirs. There are also many dining options and cheaper takeout options here, although the cheapest is probably 7-11. The hotel is located on the south side of the station. On the north side, which is a 5 minute walk away, there are more restaurants, lots of local delicacies in the basement of Isetan (look for LUCUA) and a Studio Ghibli store. There is also a stationery store next to a Starbucks on the 9th floor selling the cutest cards and stickers. Despite being able to see the trains pull into the station from our room, there were no noise issues." .

Other than that it was a comfortable stay if you don't compare it to North American Standards. - We didn't expect a breakfast in the morning at a hotel in Japan so that was a great plus specially when we didn't know where to go eat in the area in the mornings as the hotel is in the business disctract. I also recommend if you are getting to this hotel from the Subway on the Midosuji line get off at Honmachi station and walk to exit 26-28. if you try to get out of the station any earlier you will be walking forever on the streets which may seem a bit confusing on your first trip to Osaka. Getting out at these exits gets you within two blocks of the hotel as opposed to like 6-8 blocks." .

Two stops to namba station (where dotonburi is), tennoji station (where abeno harukas is) and osaka castle. There are 7-eleven and familymart at the main cross junction near the hotel but if you are lazy, they have vending machine at the reception area. They have a shared microwave oven in the lobby and coin operated washing machine and dryer in the top floor. They also provided free umbrella but have to return it which is useful if raining." .

In the end, I just feel that although it was cheap, I would rather up my price-point and stay somewhere nicer. - The location was very convenient--close to the station as well as several restaurants and shops. The staff was also quite friendly." .

You continue on underground towards Namba walk and Midosuji line. Very handy if raining or lugging heavy luggage. Withing walking distance of Dotonbori, near supermarkets and many many restaurants. Room was a little small but had very comfortable beds, cool aircon and even a fold out table to sit and have meals. Very reasonable price for the location." .

Toilet facilities are fairly dated by Japanese standards, no rain shower and less sophisticated WC system. - Great location, close to Namba subway lines and short walking distance to Dotonbori without being too close to the noise factor. Time frames spent in Japanese city rooms are minimal so this, despite its size, would serve a night's purpose fine. I've stayed at the Monterrey Granmere Osaka with very similar layout, size and amenities, and with further walking distance to Dotonbori for costs about 30% higher." .

You can walk to 0101 and Takashimaya through the underground walkway. It was great for us as we went there in December and it was very cold outside. The first few nights we rented a car as we were travelling to other cities around kansai. The hotel has an underground parking in the same building and parking fee was very reasonable." .

Our room had only amenities for one person, instead of 2 pax as per our reservation. However, front reception lady was very apologetic and personally sent the amenities to our room. 4. Breakfast service starts at only 7am. - When I dropped my key ring through the elevator gap into the lift well, I didn't hold much hope of ever seeing it again. However, I still informed the front desk requesting that they look for it the next time they carry out their routine maintenance on their one elevator servicing all the hotel floors.

What to do Osaka Aquarium is accessible from ferry on back side. There is plethora of restaurants near Universal Studios all walking distance from hotel including Starbucks and Hard Rock Cafe.

Hotel restaurant did not have a large range of meal options from the menu we saw - it didn't need to be Western but at least something other than sushi would have been nice. It was the reason we didn't eat there. - Very close to the river & a few dining options. You need to get the subway to Namba to get to Shinsaibashi & Nipponburi. 10-20 minute walk to Osaka castle from the hotel. Very convenient location - just outside of the hustle and bustle with a 7/11 just downstairs.

We spent 20 days in Japan and found this hotel was very good although quite expensive compared with other similar hotels we stayed at in different cities. - The private bathroom (Japanese style) was awesome, bath just big enough to fit two people and I loved the sitting down showers. There was a lot of variety at breakfast, although not exactly to my taste. The location was fantastic - a couple of minutes' walk to the Dotonburi area and short walk to great transport links." .

Double room was a very good size, the mattress was extremely comfortable, the shower heavenly, every detail thought of. Reception staff were lovely and always made an effort. Coffee at reception was very good too. Close to two subway stations, and not far from main Osaka station. There is a very nice looking gastropub style bar as part of the hotel - we did not have a chance to try it out but it was popular amongst the local crowd and the food smelt very enticing." .

The entrance, as of artistic reason I presumptuously assumed, was designed to be an asymmetric automatic door made of wood. For reason I yet had known, when I was trying to find the hotel in the street which Google map led me to, I overlooked the hotel by thinking this wooden door is a deserted plank. - This hotel is just fantastic. The staffs are very nice and friendly, and the hotel is exceedingly stylish, with a modern-world artistic touch to every designs either in the room or the hallway. Rooms are pretty clean, and every facilities are meticulously placed in a ingenious way so that none of them seemed to block the way. The bar, or should I call it a restaurant since there aren't much alcohol offered, a walk away from the hotel is pretty nice too. There are plenty of other restaurants that seemed to be quite decent just accros the street." .

All staff were very professional and friendly. Instead of throwing our food & stuff we cold not bring home away, we decided to leave it for the staff and next guests to use esp all our almost brand umbrellas. The room fits 3 beds and were just nice. The toilet space is more than sufficient to move around. All toiletries were plentiful for use including mineral water we cldn't finish! We liked the feel of security & privacy. Altho a very old & huge hotel, the carpets all feel very clean & we've seen the security doing his rounds checking all exit doors. My kid enjoy the kit kat treats at the reception every morning. Very conducive for family on tours. I want to give excellent credit to its location to both the Namba train station & the limousine bus service direct to the airport. Bonus for the shopping just below the hotel - supermarket, DCM & DIASO shopping, etc. The moment we are hungry for breakfast or arrived late for dinner, there are plenty of restaurants & cafe below the hotel along the Namba walkway right after arrival at the Namba station which conveniently connects the JR Line & the subway." .

This made it difficult to take advantage of the room's amenities/location . I stayed 5 days and the cleaning staff never came once (garbage was piling up). Still enjoyed my stay but with a little move effort/conscientiousness on behalf of the host it could of been way better - Relatively good size place with plenty of appliances: kitchenette, stove, and washing machine.

        hip:hasText  "We booked a double room, not a bed bunk. The room lacked any amenities, even that it was clean. The worst? A huge window with NO CURTAINS. Yeah, there was a very thin cloth hanging in there -the ones used when you want the light to go in totally but avoid to be seen from outside-, but not a real curtain. Result? At 6AM you have full light. Even at deep night there's a lot of light from the outside. So be ready not to rest unless you can sleep with daylight in your face. The room is ultra small -common Japanese, I understand- with only space for the bed. But no hangers or wall hanks, no shelves, no nothing. So your luggage will be scattered on the bed, as there's almost no space on the floor. Is that difficult to have hangers and upper shelves? I don't ask for more space, just to use the walls, Ikea sells stuff like that really cheap. As said before, the room is comfortable, clean and up to standards. But stupid things as lacking a curtain, hangers or shelves makes it uncomfortable. Even worst? Yeah. No towels. Even no towels at the toilet. For what reason? Of course, for you to pay 200 yen of a rental fee for a towel... what? As stated, it was a double room that costed 80 US dollars per night. And can't have a towel? The toilet has shampoo, conditioner and even new hair dryers... but no towels. Forced to pay for it. Even if you wash your hands you need to depend on your own towel. Even no tissues. And then, no common spaces, only an expensive bar on the ground floor. Not a single glass of water for free, if you want water there's the tap, the 7 Eleven on the street behind or paying a bar price to them. Yeah, they offer breakfast for 500 yen, but for that I prefer to go to the shops around. Anyway, very clean hostel that looks gorgeous on some points, but the whole experience gets destroyed for these small but necessary things you need. Curtains, hangers, towels or a glass of water. - The place is a very clean hostel with really good showers. The room was clean as well. And the location, even is not a prime one, it's only a 5 minutes walk to Shinsaibashi. Great for me." .

Felt like a bag of rocks at first! I did however sleep quite well and did manage to get comfortable. I think the hotel has become quite dated. With some refurb I think it would be a very luxurious hotel. - Location was brilliant, very easy to get to Osaka station and to Shin- Osaka station and directly next to the station exit. Obviously incredible access to usj. View was great from room, there are a lot of other hotels blocking the way unfortunately but it was still pretty incredible. Rooms on the other side of the hall may have had great views of the park etc. Big rooms and a very good bathroom. Huge bed. 24 hour Lawson just downstairs along with City Walk - shops, mcdonalds, tgi fridays, lots of other food places, souvenirs. All sorts! Good staff, keep bags before and after checkout. Breakfast had a lot of variety but standard Japanese - anybody craving a western breakfast will be disappointed. (Croissants were amazing though!) Good value for money." .

However, found space not ideal to western standards and too small to move around within the confines of commercial use. Changing to slippers places greater burden to international visitors and not in a norm of 4 star category hotel. No bath tub in room is another down-side. Thus, cost performance would be good if kept in the range of 15,000 to 17,000 inclusive of tax. Anything higher would not be worth a repeat visit." .

There are excellent native and international restaurants nearby, and the major subway and train arteries, plus the airport shuttle station are all within walking distance.

I actually ended up checking to see if there even was a mattress on the bed or if we were sleeping on a bed frame. Since the bed was so uncomfortable it was incredibly difficult to get a good nights sleep. I was exhausted the next day and it made it difficult to do sightseeing. I also ended up using the onsen at nights as well as in the mornings because my neck and lower back were in a lot of pain from the bed. - The location was right outside a subway entrance which made it incredibly easy and convenient to get around. It was also a ten-minute walk from Osaka station and about a 10-minute train ride to Dotonbori.

Many nice and reasonably priced restaurants nearby (1st floor mall area). $15 bus shuttle to Osaka airports if you need it." .

When I rang the front desk I was told my bill had exceeded 50,000 yen and to come to the front desk and pay as soon as possible. I was worried that someone was making fake charges under my name but all it was was they wanted payment for the first two nights even though I was staying five nights ! When I asked for an explanation I was told it was company policy. The staff then became irritated and frustrated with me when I asked why I could not pay my complete bill when I checked out of the hotel ? Booking.com should stop promoting this hotel till the hotel management changes this policy. - Location to JR services and convenience for travelling to Universal Studios Osaka." .

I would recommend finding something closer to Osaka station because the walk to Yotsubashi station regardless of what train you take is a very far walk. Even if you take a closer train in Osaka station you'll end up walking a good mile-mile and a half to the hotel as there are only 2 train stations near this hotel.

So the usable space in twin is def. smaller than double. Most twin room is usually more expensive and bigger in Japan, if you are thinking like this, it's not happen in this hotel. - The bed is extra comfy. The staffs are very helpful and friendly.

        hip:hasText  "Extra service - I asked for hair straighter for male but they offered me one for female. I asked for this because Korean hair straighter has 220v but the outlet in the bathroom has only 110v so using universal adapter for 220v has less power(almost impossible to straight your hair with less power of heat). That's why I needed to use Japanese one(110V) for hotter heat. This service was not so good enough compared to 5 stars standard. Breakfast - The restaurant for breakfast for ordinary guests(Not club intercontinental) was very disappointing. I don't remember what there was clearly because many of food was not tasty for us so we moved to the club intercontinental lounge for breakfast. It was of course better because it's only for VIP who paid more. I have been to tens of 5 stars hotel breakfast in the world and this place was worst. Sorry that I can't describe how all food was because I don't remember clearly but I remember there was not so various menu for someone like me. One more thing, what made me shocked was there is no Japanese restaurant in this hotel! I expected to try the best sushi and sashimi in 5 stars hotel but NO SUSHI restaurant at all. This ruined our feeling since the first day after we heard there was no any... The staff explained me why there is not and she said it's because there are many sushi restaurants around this hotel so that kind of Japanese restaurants can't open in this hotel. I don't understand this logic clearly even though she explained it to me. Probably it can be my fault not to check what kind of restaurants there are before I booked but I couldn't expect that 5 stars hotel in Japan doesn't have any Japanese restaurants for sushi or sashimi. So we had to go somewhere nearby. - Staff - Perfect , I will give you 100 points out of 100! Even if that's their job, I felt they truly love to helping guests and offering extra service. Location - I think it was pretty okay since we used taxi all the time. But if not, you should consider one more time. You have to walk for 10 mins to get to the nearest station or something as far as I remember. Room - 5 stars standard as you expect" .

If you had to do something with your bag or whatever you do while sitting down on a bed, you had to put everything on the bed, legs and stuff. 2. There were times the heater wouldn't work??? Or has the water run out already? Idk sometimes even while taking a bath, the water would suddenly go cold even when we didn't adjust the heater knob on the shower. - Very near the station, clean, and convenient! Roof deck, vending machine, free tea, free leg massage machine, free use of eating utensils (glasses, mugs, small plates), a community night with free snacks and cocktail drinks every Mon & Thursday, good soap and shampoo, place smells nice, it really felt like our little Osaka home in the 4 nights we stayed there. Dotonbori is 2 stations away, Kuromon market 1 station away, and both could be accessed by foot in about less than 20 minutes or so. There's a family mart, 7/11, KFC, a mall, and Don Quixote/DonKi within the vicinity, all also in walking distance. The vicinity feels safe and quiet also, not a lot of people/crowds." .

        hip:hasText  "We were travelling around Japan for our fourth anniversary and had a frustrating and disappointing experience at this hotel. Perhaps we had been spoiled by the other hotels we stayed at in Tokyo, kyoto, Nagoya etc. The facilities needed some love and update and also a bit of elbow grease – please see photos showing stains and the black thing we found stuck to our towel. The standard room isn't that big and is more suited for a solo traveller than for two people. Our humidifier was very dusty and on one side there were what looked like coffee stains drips. We called reception to ask for a new one and they kept saying to us no, we couldn't get coffee. Eventually, they bought a new humidifier – however it made our room smell bad and we found out that it was from a smoking room. Third time lucky, (after some time) they brought us a humidifier that was a bit cleaner (but still dusty). Unlike other Japanese hotels of similar star ratings, they don't give you complimentary bottles of water – neither do they refresh your pyjamas or toiletries if you are staying for more than one night- which every other hotel we stayed at did - even the more budget ones. The staff at the front desk, with one exception, seemed curt and abrupt almost to the point of rudeness and their English was very limited. Because of the exchanges we felt very unwelcome there and left as soon as we could on the final day. We left (by mistake) some souvenir food items in our room when we left and so far no one has called us - we're going to count them as gone as we don't really want to deal with their front desk again. This is a shame as we were looking forward to staying at this hotel as it appeared to have such character. - The location wasn't bad, however it was still a bit of a walk from Osaka JR station if you have bags. That walk also isn't all under cover so bring an umbrella if raining." .

We only had two bags, and had to place one in the kitchenette and the other in the bathroom. The ‘beds’ were fold out couches and extremely uncomfortable, a mattress on the floor would have been more comfortable. We checked out two days early and moved to a bigger space as no one could sleep on the hard ‘beds’ - Great location with easy access. Apartment was clean and tidy." .

Rooms are a little small so those with big luggage will just have to lay them on the bed or any available space. Breakfast is limited western fare so can skip breakfast. There are many coffee joints and convenience stalls around the area. Staff is very friendly and speaks some English and the whole place is clean and nice." .

Very limited choice, virtually all Japanese, no fresh fruits, yoghurt or cereals and only one choice of bread. The restaurant is only open for breakfast. The shower was poor. It was a simple shower head connected by tubing and you had to stand over the flooring without any shower curtain or screen. It would have been much better to place the shower head mount over the bath, so the floor of the rest of the bathroom would not get completely wet. - Great location a few minutes walk from the train station and about a 10 minute walk to Universal studios. Large, comfortable and clean room, ideal for families." .

During 2 separate stays, I have had noise issues with Chinese guests yelling at each other in the middle of the night and in the mornings. The bathroom is also outdated, but that didn't bother me so much. However the same goes for the bed mattress, it is old and you can feel the springs in the mattress. As a side sleeper, my shoulder hurt when I got up every morning. During a total of 6 nights (2 separate stays), the room wasn't cleaned once. You also need to clear out your own trash, but this is easily done with the trash bins next to the hotel, so you can do it after the checkout. - The location is one of the best things about this hotel. Very conveniently located near a subway with 2 lines (Tanimachi & Sennichimae) at a 1-min walk and near Osaka-Uehommachi Kintetsu station at a 10-minute walk. So getting there and getting around Osaka from the hotel is really easy. For this price, this is an excellent location. The staff is friendly and both check-in and check-out are quick." .

These are ways to clean stains like this out of carpets this hotel just were not bothered. Having lived in Japan for the last three years I was surprised and disgusted by this.

The first time they checked the CCTV, said they returned it per the video. Later they reviewed it again because I insisted the passport they returned belonged to my son. When they returned to the front desk this time, they immediately found my passport on their counter (took them all of 3 seconds). Comped me with free coffee??!!@@ I think they should have given me a free meal, a free night, something significant for the hassle. I could not even get a latte with the free coupon. It was for only drip coffee or tea. Less important, though also a negative was there were no drawers, just a small closet with 4 hangers. My son and I had to live out of our suitcases for the week. - Breakfast buffet had a good selection. Housekeeping was very responsive. location was great!

We booked a room with three beds but upon arrival there were only two beds. I texted the owner and she said she'll arrange for another bed to be set up while we're out grabbing dinner. Upon return there really was a third bed, but it was rather a wooden board with a laughably thin Japanese futon thrown over it (aka it was like sleeping on a wooden board). We got a refund for the missing third \"bed\", so the owner was fair about it when approached. So recommended for two people (or if you book one double bed and one single bed), but be careful if booking for three twin beds since the third bed might mean sleeping on a board (some people don't mind sleeping on the floor, so it might not bother some) Wifi didn't work the first night, but the owner dropped by the next morning and left us her pocket wifi so we'd have internet while the router was being fixed during the day. - The owner was very friendly and eager to help, and she replied quickly via LINE and tried her best to solve whatever problem we had" .

At the check-in, I was told I could only get one key card to the room as all rooms had only one key card. It was very important for me to have two keys as my brother and I were sightseeing separately and only one key card would have been very inconvenient. I requested to see the hotel manager about it as this was unacceptable for me (it was the first hotel I've ever stayed in where I couldn't get two key cards for the double room). The next day a miracle happened as I received the second key cards. So make sure you insist on having two key cards if you need them, or contact the hotel about it prior check-in. Hotel spa available for additional 500 Yen per visit. I stayed at some other hotels (with the same price range) where access to the hotel spa was free. - Good location - literally next to the metro station entrance and walking distance to Dotonbori, room size very generous for the Japanese standards, cleanliness was great. Close to the Family Mart shop which vas very convenient. Hotel spa available for additional 500 Yen per visit." .

We had a walk-in-robe for dressing and a huge bathroom with amazing views. This hotel is so close to Universal Studios and many restaurants, groceries and shops right next to us. Ice machine and vending machine on each floor for convenience. Universal City is a great part of Osaka to stay, if you want to go to Universal Studios. It is not far from other attractions in the city, or Osaka main station." .

Location may seem central but it's on backstreets, thus not safe and not so close to metro station. Lobby is closed between 10 pm-8 am so if you need anything between those ours, there's no one. Coin laundry drying didn't work, after 3 cycles our laundry was still wet. Room was dirty, there were holes in our sheets, also slippery floor OUTSIDE of the bathroom. We fell and injured ourselves. I do not recommend it and I am sorry to see mystays quality is poor in Osaka. - Young members of staff were helpful" .

No room safe as well, but in Japan I don't think you need one. - Booked on the same day and got one of the last rooms during the peak holiday season. Stayed five day so we were happy to find that it was one of their \"suites\" where toilet and large bath were separate and it had a small sitting area with a couch and coffee table. The room was big by Japan standards where you usually don't have room to lay down your luggage and walk at the same time. Excellent value for money. Great location for the price, at the fringes of all the action (shopping and food street). Love that we had easy access to the trains, underground shopping areas, restaurants, and the OCAT. Being able to walk everywhere underground and escape the cold was great in January. Staff were very friendly and helpful; showed us where to get dinner as we arrived quite late in the evening. Helped us make phone calls relayed messages in Japanese. Overall great service." .

Osaka station is very large and busy and initially had trouble finding the Sakurabashi exit despite following the instructions provided. However after looking at some maps, we found the exit and caught the shuttle bus to the hotel (~5-7 minutes). Prior to check in, I had accidentally booked a smoking twin room and so I communicated via email with Westin staff and arranged an upgrade to a luxury twin room non smoking for a fee (unfortunately double room was not available). Upon check in, staff greeted us with our luggage which we had forwarded from a prior Tokyo hotel to Westin Osaka. The lobby is spacious and beautiful. The location of this hotel is a little away from Osaka station with a large construction site separating the two however is in a quiet area right next to Umeda sky building. Also there is a convenience store just in front of the hotel if you need snacks. Our luxury twin room was just so spacious. Despite not getting a double room, we thoroughly enjoyed our large separate beds. The bathroom is spacious and I really appreciated the Western-style separate shower (rather than shower over bath arrangement) which I had missed during our 3 week trip in Asia. I was also thrilled by the double vanity. The beds and pillows were comfortable and the view from the 22nd floor was great. There is also a great eating area in the basement area of Umeda sky building which has plenty of food options. We mostly used the shuttle bus to go to Osaka station but we also walked to and from Osaka station a few times (there is an underpass) which takes about 10-15 minutes depending on your walk speed. For example, the last shuttle bus from Osaka station to the hotel is approximately 10pm and we walked back from the station to the hotel at about 10:30pm - there were plenty of other people and it was safe." .

There wasn't really enough space to walk between the two beds, so two people had to decide who wanted to be up against the wall and who got to have room on their side to walk. I didn't know that the beds would be like that. For the price, I was a little upset. Plus no free breakfast and they didn't even have a business center to use a computer to check in online for our flight. Hotel was okay, but I'm not sure I would stay there again or if I would recommend it to others. - On one hand it was good that it was in train station, on the other hand it you were constantly dodging people just to walk over to 711." .

Smell of cigarette is really strong when the lift doors opened to take guests to the 3/F reception and lobby area. The hotels shared the four lifts with the pachinko shop where most Japanese customers are heavy smokers! The carpet on the guest room is full of stain and walking bare footed is not recommended. The activities of some rooms facing the atrium with blinds opened would have their privacy compromised as people in the lifts could see their activities through the lif's glass wall. Also the hotel will charge guest for late check out even the period is just one hour after the 11:00am check-out time. - The location is excellent. Just a 3 minutes walk to the Namba Walk- the underground street. Lots of restaurants are around the hotel and local Threatre is only a few steps away. It is close to the Nankai Rapi:t train station to Kansai Int'l Airport. Also the JR Namba terminal is within 10 minutes walk. All and all, almost all subway lines are within 5 minutes walk from the hotel." .

        hip:hasText  "The hotel rooms and especially the bathroom was very small. The bathtub was extremely small, so showering was a challenge. The walls were thin, so you can hear your neighbours talking sometimes. The hotel lies directly beneath the flight path to Itami airport, so big planes will fly by, but the noise was acceptable as the hotel room windows were closed anyway. There's no noise pollution from the trains though. - A simple, no frills hotel that offers decent accomodation with friendly staff. The best thing I like about this hotel is the convenience. Its just a few steps from Shin-Osaka station. You can either cross the yellow overhead bridge, or enter the station from the east gate. So after a long and tiring day on your feet, you don't have to walk very far to get back. Just up the street towards the station there is a Lawsons store and next to it is a little restaurant that serves a decent meal for less than 1000yen. Shin-Osaka station itself has its fair share of restaurants and eateries too. The hotel breakfast was simple, alternating between western and japanese. The homemade yogurt and jam was delicious. The air-conditioner is individually controlled, so you can set the temperature to your liking. Bed and pillows were comfortable and housekeeping does a good job at cleaning. This hotel is perfect if you plan to explore Japan via Shinkansen, because it stops at Shin-Osaka station. If you want to go to Osaka/Umeda station, you can take JR-Kobe line or Midosuji subway (about 5 mins). The Midosuji line will bring you straight into Namba/Dotombori area without having to change trains." .

When we requested that since we placed the order the day before, could you just pack the chicken wrap option we selected, we got a rather rude reply from the lady at the reception of, \"Sorry, that is not our rule\" (find a better way to say it or be flexible when there is a senior citizen!). Hospitality is poor and they run a jail! The room from the view - let's not talk about it because there is none. This hotel is a minimum 450m walk from Hommachi station (temple side). Not much by way of convenience stores like Family Mart, Lawson or 7-11 in the neighbourhood. And this was the most pricey hotel in our trip amongst Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima. Not worth the money.

They are fitted with airco for the summer." .

        hip:hasText  "The service was noticeably worse than other hotels we stayed at in Japan. I was so used to locals and people in hospitality in Japan greeting me with smiles and a friendly manner, so I was quite surprised that the check-in staff at the counter were not that friendly. They don't greet you when you walk back in the hotel to catch the lift to your room either. The location is great, but it will take at least one subway ride (maybe two) to get into interesting areas such as Dotonbori. If you're planning to take day trips out (such as to Himeji or Miyajima etc.) and you need to get to Shin-Osaka to use the Shinkansen, a hotel with easier access to Shin Osaka on the same JR Line would be more convenient as we had to take one subway ride into Higashi Umeda and then transfer to Osaka Station, then take another train to Shin-Osaka before we boarded on the Shinkansen. The bed was a little hard, same with the pillows. The room didn't smell bad per se, but didn't smell that good either. - This is a good value-for-money hotel in Osaka. One of the most affordable of the ones I have seen around. There are no special thrills or anything, but you get what you pay for. The room is a little small but clean enough. The hotel is conveniently located next to Osaka Castle, the subway station and 3 convenience stores. (A 7-11 is a 30 second walk from the hotel). Has all the amenities needed - toiletries, a kettle, television, telephone etc." .

Therefore if you have a lot of baggage (which we did) then it actually becomes a big hassle if you're not staying for an extended period. It is also a bit away from the centre of Osaka so it takes 25-30 mins to get most places of interest. I would not both with breakfast as we opted for Western breakfast but it consisted of some small egg sandwiches and optional toast/yogurt. We would have been much happier with some cereal and milk! - Clean and comfortable hotel." .

Need to get 3 tickets to get places so transport fare adds up and can't get daily pass on this train line. Really only suitable for people wanting to stay specifically in the area. I wouldn't recommend hotel for Osaka tourists based purely on location. - Perfect hotel. Totally exceptional and responsive. Everything was excellent." .

Two things in my room I hated: the manky brown stains running down the walls and the big, exposed blanket on the bed - some of which was not covered by a sheet/duvet - I dread to think the last time it was washed...I Tried to avoid touching it at all costs. The room needs serious aesthetic attention - so much so that I feel like actually offering to paint the walls of the room I stayed in - it would make such a difference. Another major issue I had was with the wifi...it was very inefficient the day I arrived, I found myself having to leave my room every 5 minutes, approach the router to connect again, then return to my room...this action must have been repeated about 20 times (In fairness, though, reception did allow me to check internet access from another 2 rooms). Unfortunately, I have to say that this is not a place that would necessarily make you look forward to returning to your room in the evenings... - The location is near Osaka Tower (near two metro/train stations) and close to a very interesting restaurant/nightlife area; It's located ten metro stops from the Shin Osaka train station, but also on another train line - Osaka Loop Line - which will take you to Nara (without having to go back into central Osaka). I liked the fact that there was a microwave on each floor and that there was a fridge in my room. I liked the 'spa/sauna' they have - although it's not fancy, I used it every evening." .

There were plenty of restaurants in the streets behind the hotel but none had English menus which made it a little tricky trying to order. The staff were very nice and helpful, but this might not suit some people who would prefer more touristy area. - We were given a large room with 3 beds. Plenty of towels, pillows and free bottled water. The hotel was very close to Osaka Castle the Osaka Museum of History (which is excellent) and also a subway station on Chuo Line - one change to Shin-Osaka. It was a simple hotel, but adequate for our needs." .

        hip:hasText  "It's quite far from the city center so the train rides can take some time which can eat up into your itinerary. If you have limited time in Osaka and also plan to use this hotel as base for your trips to Kyoto, Nara and other nearby cities, you must take into consideration the travel time from the hotel to the city center, e.g. Shin-Osaka, Osaka, Umeda stations. We really didn't mind the travel time because our group absolutely loved the hotel but its location is one that must be taken into consideration if you're pressed for time. - I traveled with family (8 of us - 3 young kids, 5 adults 2 of which are seniors). We got the big room with 8 beds (bunk style) and we loved it. We just came from Tokyo where we had really cramped accommodation (understandable coz it's Tokyo after all) so our room at GS was really spacious and nicely designed. The beds were very comfortable. I had difficulty waking up my 3 young kids coz they were enjoying their sleep too much. It was that comfortable. I too wanted to snuggle some more under the soft sheets but Osaka was waiting to be explored so had to force myself out of my nice cocoon. The toilets and bathrooms were also spacious and very clean. The lounge felt so welcoming and yes it was clean and spacious. You can cook or heat your own food. Plates and utensils are provided for free. Food was no problem. There were stores nearby. We survived on take out food from 711 and Lawsons, both just a few steps away from the hotel, and ate them in the hotel lounge. There's a subway station (Moriguchi Station, Exit 2) close to Lawsons so transportation is no problem. Be sure to get the one day pass especially as the Moriguchi station is quite far from the city center. You'll have to change trains a lot to get to destinations in Osaka. The one day pass saved us time and money as getting individual tickets would have been costly. I would highly recommend GS and if I have another chance to visit Osaka, it is most likely that I will stay here again. And I'll make sure that next time I will enjoy this comfortable hotel some more." .

The woman at the reception was fair to recommend me to park at another parking place, for 2200 yen per day. I don't get it, why do you have a private parking lot for your guests and you still take the same amount of money as the public parkings...

I've been sending them email several weeks ago requesting for bigger rooms but they did not reply. Comforters and linens are very comfy but I think the bed needs some changing. TV is too big with few channels available. It occupies space considering the size of the room. - Location. The best feature in this hotel is the location. It is just in front of Higobashi station A3 exit. It was very accessible to go around Osaka. Spa. There's a free spa in the 2nd floor. It is so relaxing to our aching body from all the walking around Osaka. Buffet breakfast.. you have choice of international and Vietnamese. Both are good selection and affordable. Convenient stores, coffee shops i.e. Seattles best, restaurant and bar nearby." .

The subway station Daikokucho is on the same line as Shin-Osaka station and railway station Imamiya is also within walking distance. The area surrounding the place has supermarkets and restaurants as well as convenience stores so you can eat out, buy some sushi from the grocery or even cook something yourself in the small kitchen area. Rooms aren't super modern but very comfortable. Very friendly staff and the very tall hotel (over 10 floors) made for great views.

The room itself was on the smaller side; although this is likely to be the norm hotels within Japanese cities. However it was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Additionally the staff and cleaning people were incredibly polite and helpful (and there was an easy to use laundry room on my floor)." .

They have a complex policy of giving out locker keys and exchanging keys for other lockers and so on... hard ot understand why.

Comfort is obviously limited but one should take that into account. The pods are quite spacious and spotless clean, with a funny vintage feel to them (like many things in Japan). On the top (10th) floor you can access for free to the internal Ofuro-Onsen (traditional bathhouse), which is actually the only place you can wash (no showers!). Here you can simmer in the large hot tub with whirlpools, compensate in the \"frigidarium\" (ice-cold tub) or enjoy the spectacular view of the city from inside the Sauna.

I have asked this to the hotel for one room stay while booking itself, but no response from hotel staff. So last minute excess pay for me for two rooms. - Access from metro station is good. No need to any taxi which is expensive in Japan! Overall clean ambience and well maintained rooms." .

The showers are a bit of a joke, not clean and falling apart. Also there were just 2 men showers for the whole place. No isolation in terms of noise, you get woken up often by people just walking outside your room or in the stairs. Electric wires hung from the ceiling at several places.

Otherwise the temperature and water pressure were great, so just a minor annoyance. - Desk staff was very helpful providing directions when needed, a loaner umbrella for a day it didn't stop raining, and answering all questions I had regarding nearby attractions. The room was a decent size, with a small sitting area, desk, tv, and bed you could walk around all sides. The bed was firm but not too hard, and the air conditioner / heater kept the room at a comfrotable temperature. The area around the hotel is quiet at night which is nice so you can get a decent night of sleep before going out to see the sights the next day. Laundry, groceries and dining options all within a block of the hotel." .

I have been in Japan for 2 weeks now and stayed in 3 different hotels 3* hotels; this one is terrible by comparison and ironically the most expensive out of all!! Yes, most hotel rooms in cities in Japan are small, but this was tiny. The bathroom was like one you would find on a plane and they have utilised one tap for the sink and the shower (see pictures). Due to the size of the bathroom, water goes everywhere when showering. No complimentary drinking water provided at all (they charge 100¥ a bottle at reception however we got some from the shop next door for 62¥ per bottle) and there was no safe in the room. All of the rooms have windows looking directly at the adjacent buildings so there's no point in opening the curtains as there is no view whatsoever. No television channels are in English therefore no access to any news. The mattress on the bed was extremely springy (you can feel the springs when you lie down) and they only provide one pillow each. There is no sound-proofing, you can hear all the noise from the corridor and adjacent rooms. As a non-smoker I found the fact that they dedicate the whole of the 2nd floor lobby to smokers appalling. This means the smoke wafts into the lifts and down to the hotel entrance. General maintenance of the hotel i.e. Carpets and walls is redundant. Don't waste your money here, a hostel or capsule hotel would be equivalent if not better. Very disappointed. - Nothing about this hotel was good, other than the location" .

The room is bigger than the standard in Japan, it was a nice change after having stayed in Tokyo, but the hotel is quite old (looks like an old apartment building which was turned into a hotel). The staff are great and they speak good English." .

Feels like staying in a dorm :D with a large kitchen. The place is super clean and the common area has a nice sofa or (our favorite spot) a carpet where you can relax, read, have a drink, etc. I really recommend the private rooms, since the price is almost the same as the shared ones, plus they are big and have nice beds.

No other complaints, though. - Very much a love hotel (you couldn't tell by the fact the entire building is zebra print and \"adult only\"???) but we were really impressed with the amenities, especially compared with some of the sketchier Shibuya LHs we've stayed in. Lots of skin care products and samples, 2 different hairdryers, a fridge, super clean bathroom with huge jacuzzi bathtub, very reasonably priced room service food etc. etc. Note that there are 2 check in desks, one for Beni West and one for Beni East, and automated check in is also an option, as there's a kiosk." .

The room had a lot of wall space, in the vestibule and hallway, that they could easily have put up another two strips of hooks without affecting the aesthetics of the room. We stayed for a week, so we needed more hooks with which to hang our clothes -- at least one separate strip to hold up our jackets, coats, scarves, etc, and another strip for other clothes. Other than that, everything else was very nice. - The hotel was a short walk to the Yodoyabashi subway station, which was really convenient for our daily excursions. There was a nice supermarket about 6 blocks away, and a convenience store round the corner from the hotel. Our hotel room was very clean (which is the norm in Japan), and surprisingly spacious (we were able to open two large suitcases at the same time in the vestibule and hallway!). The beds were comfortable. We also liked the amenities bar, which gave us the freedom to take the toiletries we needed, and eschew the ones we didn't -- very practical. The housekeeping lady was very friendly and cheerful, and we looked forward to greeting her in the mornings." .

Driving to the hotel was relatively easy and we were able to park in the hotel's lot at no expense (other than handing over the keys to the staff, but it wasn't a problem since we were planning on walking and taking the train) The room was comfortable and the location was very convenient!

        hip:hasText  "Like most hotels in Japan, the air conditioner controller is in Japanese, but you can get help from staff on how to operate it. We stayed in 2 separate rooms, and there were differences such as the type of air conditioner, Tv size, kettle, etc. So I suppose it depends on luck which ones you will get. They do not clean or service the room if you stay less than 7 days, and because of that, you need to separate, bag, and throw away your own garbage. You can ask for additional trash can plastic bags from reception. You can also get additional towels from the reception for a small 50 yen fee, which might be a bother for some people. None of these are big issues for me, so I'm still happy with my stay. - One of the reason why we choose this place was the location, and thankfully it fits the bill. It is very close to Daikokucho subway station, which is only 1 stop away from Namba station. But because it was close, we ended up just taking a leisurely walk there everyday (flat land, no elevation). It is about 20 minutes walk to Dotonbori where the famous Glico running man billboard is, among other attractions. Both the receptionists we encountered speak very good English, and they can also give recommendations on your needs during your stay. The room itself is bigger than most places, as this is actually an apartment complex, so think of it as a studio service apartment where it'd be comfortable to stay for weeks or even months. The room has a kitchen sink, fridge, induction heating cooker, kettle, tableware and utensils, so you can actually cook a meal if you want to. Shared microwave and coin laundry machines are also available, while a hairdryer can be rented (500 yen, but will be returned to you). There is a large budget grocery store and lawson100 very close by for you to get ingredients and cheap ready meals. The bed is very comfortable, with thick comforters for the winter. Guests are expected to be mindful of noise, especially past 10pm, so overall I got good sleep during my stay." .

Onsen was great especially after a long day of walking and shopping around. Free soba offered at night was also great." .

        hip:hasText  "It all went downhill from when we stepped into the hotel. My partner and I had been travelling for several hours and when we arrived we were drenched and exhausted. Whilst completing the check-in, the receptionist demanded that we pay for our stay right away. She told us that we were not allowed to see our room first (this is not common practice. Guests have the right to see what they pay for!). She refused our request to see the room, even when I told her that my partner had his money in his suitcase. He was then forced to get down on all fours, in the hotel lobby, open his suitcase in front of everyone (all staff could then see where he kept his valuables) proceeded to dig through his belongings to find his money. We were not the only ones made to do this, as the following day I saw a family of 4 (with young children) also on the floor, searching through their bags. I have never in all my years of travel experienced such disrespect from hotel staff. The fact that they would humiliate their guests like this is completely inexcusable. Forcing guests to pay on the spot is incorrect, and I did not like being taken for a foreign thief, who is presumed to run away and not pay for their stay. I reserved through Booking.com so they obviously had my card details. This experience was incredibly demeaning, insulting and rude, and the receptionist simply smirked at us the entire time (I presume this was amusing for her). Our stay did not improve from that point on. The hotel was very outdated (stain-glass windows, old furniture, dirt coloured walls...), the bed was uncomfortable and the room was minimally cleaned (dust everywhere especially around the bed, floor was grey etc.). The following day I took a shower, and found hairs on my towel. This was utterly revolting. This hotel is overpriced for what you get. A few houses down there is a Holiday Inn which is of good, professional standard, and the price is very similar. - The location was good, quiet, but that's about it." .

The staff even waved goodbye when we were all going back to the airport and he helped us figure out how to go to kansia airport. There are also a lot of places to eat and a grocery store about 5 mins walk" .

The room was *tiny*, not as pictured. We had to shuffle sideways *single-file* to get into the room. More like a linen closet, really. While I don't speak any Chinese, my friend does and while we were checking in, one staff member asked another, \"Did you clean the room?\" The response was, \"I think so.\" How reassuring. My pillow was a baby shower gift, complete with the child's name and birthday--almost *10 years* ago. It was definitely made for a child, as well, so besides being old, it was also uselessly small. I was not expecting much for the price I paid, but everywhere else I've been in this area of Japan (and I've been in this country for 16 months now) has been better than this place. - It was close to the Midosuji Line, which was convenient." .

The rooms are very clean and the beds comfortable. The AC works really well, and the wifi is strong as every room has its own router. It's a typical Japanese room, which means it's relatively small. Once you have your suitcases open, there won't be much space to walk around. It's really close to streets with numerous izakayas and restaurants that open late, lots of eating options. Osaka station is about 10 minutes by foot, which isn't super close, but definitely not far either." .

The staff were really friendly and helpful. Even though daily housekeeping was not provided, it wasn't that much of an issue as long as you keep the room clean. Items like hairdryer can be loaned with a deposit but just note that you may not get the deposit back if you are checking out early in the morning. The surrounding areas has super markets that opens till late where you can do grocery shopping." .

They didn't check the room number and didn't give to two of my colleagues the breakfast vouchers respectively. And my colleagues waited for it for 30 min. and we had a late breakfast, duly, we couldn't get the train to the airport on time. I asked those male receptionists why you didn't check the room and give the vouchers since we paid for it when we checked-in. But, they didn't give me proper answer - keep silent and pretending not speaking English well. Shortly, they disregard us. Actually, I wanted to complain about those staffs, but, I don't have a time for it since we`re on the rush. - Location is good, easy access to the public transport" .

I read that it s so far from the center, but if you take the monrail and the subway only takes you 20 min to go to the centre." .

There is a separate humidifier in the room which needs manual switch-on and does the job of bringing air humidity back to pleasant levels, however it only works if there is enough water in the tank and it does make a certain noise. Again, this is not specific to the Kitahama Brighton City hotel but it is noteworthy. I got a parcel delivered to the hotel but there was no notification, I had to call the front desk and ask if by any chance it had arrived, on which they checked and confirmed. Normally I would expect that one gets a proactive message to the room in such case. - A still quite new. modern hotel with nice design both of lobby as well as of rooms. Good beds, Good bathroom. Clean and well maintained. Friendly staff. Efficient check-in and check-out. Convenience store right across the street, next subway station 5 min away." .

I just so happened to noticed a stain coming through from under the sheet and when my boyfriend pulled the sheet back then was a proper blood stain on the mattress protector. Obvious as the day light, and so my boyfriend immediately rang the front desk asking someone to come to the room. When they did he showed them and told them we will not be staying in this room, and would prefer a refund and for us to stay elsewhere. After us demanding to speak to the hotel manager he finally came to the room and instantly arranged for us to be moved to a suite room, and have our first night refunded. Although it made the first night uneasy for us the rest of the stay was great and the upgrade was unreal. We had such a large room and all the staff were extremely apologetic. I didn't like the hygiene of the hotel overall and for what we paid would try somewhere else next time. - I liked where the hotel was situated, having quite a few restaurants and convenience stores near by. Plus having Fukushima station right across the road made it super easy to explore the city." .

So don't assume 2 people would feel comfortable in what they call a semi-double, or only if you are outside most of the day. 3) their rates would soar for certain high-demand weekends or tourist periods. In that case, make comparisons and think twice your main purpose of being in Osaka and whether it's worth the expense. - 1) Great breakfast buffet and good value if you include it in your hotel booking. (if you buy it on a daily basis after you check in, it's 1,300 yen, which is not expensive if you could take time enjoying it.) 2) It's away from the hustle and bustle of city streets, but easy to get to any attraction in Osaka. I always feel safe and relaxed going back to the hotel or strolling in the area late in the evenings. 3) I usually take Airport Limousine (destination: Umeda, New Hankyu) and at Umeda Station take Midosuji Line but get off at Nishinakajima (1 stop before Shin Osaka). It's only 2 more mins of walking than Shin Osaka station, but a much more straightforward exit from subway (esp. with a big luggage). At Nishinakajima, exit at Gate 1, where you look to the left and see Toudor Coffee across from the street. Walk on Toudor's sidewalk but along the big railway/highway. Keep walking after you go across a big intersection and you should see the sign of the hotel before you turn left to it. 4) 1 min walk from Nishinakajima is Minamikata Station of the Hankyu Railway, which could take you to Kobe or Kyoto with a low fare, and to me it's a more fun ride than Shin-kan sen." .

Had to change trains three times to get there from Shin-Osaka and then to get to any of the other common places to go around Osaka (Nara, Kobe, Namba) all required multiple changing of trains. Also, it's located in a business district with very limited options to eat or shop around so you're basically forced to catch the three trains to another location in order to find something to eat. We ended up walking 20 minutes to Kyobashi a few times as there are quite a few restaurants there. Also, to use any of the facilities (gym, pool, sauna) was an additional 3700 JPY per person per visit which seems completely ridiculous. When you factor in the additional cost to use the facilities on top of your room rate it really depletes the value of the property. Also, the property seemed overly pretentious and seemed to be geared away from travelers and more so businessmen. Therefore, I would recommend this property for business but not if you're planning on seeing the sights. - Our room had views of Osaka Castle which was nice however, there was construction on that side of the building so cranes and such were in the way. The staff were very nice which is simply to be expected when traveling to Japan as it appears that everyone in Japan is incredibly polite and kind. The hotel is visually appealing inside and appeared to have good shopping options on the ground level if that is what you're into. Also, the main reason why we stayed at Hotel New Otani was because they're Japanese and only located in Japan which was an added experience." .

Not possible to check in before 3 pm at all, because all the rooms are being cleaned and not a single room is clean before that?! Then asked if they could clean my room first thing in the morning, so that I could give to my colleague. Again at first not possible before three pm, then after long time complaining and proposing to even clean the room myself so that my colleague, after a long flight from Europe, could at least have access to a room, they finally managed to come around and confirm they could clean my room first at 10 am.

Due to a typhoon raging outside we ate in at the Hotel restaurant and the service was quite slow, but the food was good. - Mitsui Garden Hotels are reliably good quality for a mid-range travellers' budget with well-laid-out rooms, comfortable beds and pillows, and contemporary design. The top-floor communal bath was particularly good here. The free shuttle bus to Osaka station is a much-appreciated bonus." .

But these are really minor things. - Neighbourhood around the property was great. Keihan mall is connected to the hotel, it had some great restaurants, supermarket, basement floor which was selling food, small streets on the other side of the station with small japanese style restaurants etc. It is also walking distance from the Osaka castle. Room size was sufficient - I expected it to be smaller from the reviews I read." .

        hip:hasText  "Cleanliness: I didn't like that there were some strands of hair in the tub, on the floor, etc. It made me wonder if the room was adequately cleaned before we checked in. For the price, the bathroom looks like a pre-fabricated bathroom and had that airplane toilet feeling. AMENITIES: For such a luxurious hotel you would expect that an IN-ROOM safe would be available. LOCATION: If you had a JR pass then staying at the hotel would be convenient. We did not have one and did not like using the loop (too many stops, too long travel time) so there was really no advantage for us to be right above the JR Namba Station. We went to Dotonbori and Shinsaibashi almost everyday and found the walk from hotel to these areas too far and too tiring. The first time was fine but passing by it everyday was a little boring and a waste of time. To conserve energy (and save our aching feet) we would take a taxi to Dotonbori or Shinsaibashi or Sennichimae Suji (just 640-680 JPY) and walk around once we get to the area. As far as taxi is concerned, we found that the hotel was on the wrong side of the street and driver would need to take the long route to get us to Dotonbori, Kuromon Market etc. We did not like using the interconnected Namba Walk because we found it too stuffy, too warm/hot, and a bit confusing. During this trip we used the Midosuji Line most often (to get to Osaka Station / Umeda, Shinsaibashi etc.) so we feel that a hotel closer to the center of the Namba Station would serve us better next time. LOBBY: We don't mind that the lobby is on the 22nd floor but we wish that the hotel would place a few seats on the ground floor lobby of the hotel/building. There is more than enough space along the corridor! It would be a good place for a short rest from a full day of touring and also a convenient place to sit while waiting for private tour/vehicle/taxi. CHECK-IN: We were a big group of 20 people and 9 rooms between us all. - Twin Room with City View on the 29th floor. This review is mostly about coming from the point of view of physically-challenged, unathletic people with tired, aching feet. For us, the less walking and taking stairs, the better. LOCATION: We loved that there was a real supermarket/grocery at the basement that closes at 12 MN! Convenient for buying midnight snacks, the next day's breakfast, and even last minute Japanese goodies for taking home. The hotel was located next door to the Namba OCAT (airport bus terminal) which made airport transfers super easy. Aside from the supermarket there were also several shops with knickknacks, Japanese cosmetics, other stuff at the basement of the hotel and in the OCAT building next door (e.g. Daiki, Daiso, drug stores, etc.). There is also a Doutor cafe and McDonald's right under the building. The hotel is right above the JR Namba station and connected to the Namba Walk. Namba Walk is an interconnected underground walkway lined with small restaurants and shops. It is a good way to get from one place to another while escaping the rain or cold. Namba walk connects 3 subway lines (Yotsubashi, Midosuji, and Sennichimae), the JR, Kintetsu, and Nankai lines, etc. and the Namba OCAT. Being above the station made travel to the following places easier: Nara via Kintetsu Line (Nara Kintetsu station is closer to the deer park than JR Nara so we opted to take the Kintetsu Line). To get to Himeji and Kobe it was more economical for us to get a Kansai day pass (JR) so we took the loop to Osaka Station and JR Kobe line to Himeji and Kobe. The JR ticket gate is right outside the glass doors from the hotel basement. The hotel is close enough to Kuromon Market, Dotonbori etc. so it isn't too expensive to take a cab to those places. AMENITIES/ROOM SIZE: Size of twin room with city view was okay and large even. We could open 2 large suitcases and 1 handcarry trolley on the floor at the same time." .

There was no closet to put your & other stuff like toiletries. - Staff were very accommodating. I love the location it's near Dotonbori and , shinsaibashi station. There's a supermarket nearby called Foodium. You can easily get a taxi going to Nankai or Namba station for Jap Yen 600. It was easy locating the hotel from Kansai airport. We took the train going to Tenganchaya then transfer to another train to Nipponbashi. Take the lift at exit 5 if you have big bags. Around 8 minutes walk to Candeo. Going to the airport you can take a taxi to nankai station & take the airport express or the easiest way is take the limousine bus service. It will drop you directly at Kansai airport. There's a limousine bus service area very near Candeo just across the hotel. Departure time for buses to Kansai airport starts at 8:30 am tho." .

Our room was opposite of the laundry room where the cleaning staf stores there supplies and starting at 09:00 am it was very noisy (normally not a problem but due to the time difference and the long flight we tried to sleep a little longer on the first two days, wich was not possible due to all the noise). - Good location, 5 minutes to Subway station, 25 minutes on foot to Dotombori and 20 minutes on foot to Umeda.

They put us in a single at first, with only 1 pillow, bathrobe, towel, etc. When we inquired, they apologized and put us in a two person room but it was the same size room only with two pillows, towels, etc. You could hardly get our backpack and bag through the door and we had to squish them stacked in a small entryway because the rest of the room was a narrow walk to the bed and no room to move between the desk and bed. It was a very small bed for two people. I'm not sure why the price for two people is so much more expensive for the extra towel, pillow, bathrobe and slippers. I would rather they cut the bathrobe and slippers and include breakfast instead! Breakfast was pretty mediocre and as a celiac there were hardly any gluten free things I could eat. And stuff I could eat, they ran out of and did not replenish during breakfast. I hope I never stay in an APA hotel again. It was our worst hotel in Japan. They also offered too many advertisements for ladies for men staying in the hotel. I don't think it's very family friendly. Also it was annoying we showed up to check in at 2:55pm and they wouldn't check us in until 3pm, so we had a coffee outside while waiting and when we came back 10 min later, there was a long line to check in. Normal hotels let you check in when you arrive! - Close enough to walk from the train station." .

Description says there are laundry services available, however when we asked about this they advised that there wasn't a washing machine. They called a laundry service for us but it was closed for the day (this was around 5pm on a Monday). We found a coin operated laundry approx 1.5km away. - Spacious, well presented, comfortable room (loved the pillows). Great shower. Easy walk to Osaka/Umeda train station. Close to great restaurants and bars. Free wifi in room. Overall we really liked this hotel and would return if we were in Osaka." .

Subway station and near Shinsaibashi Station (5 blocks more or less) Near Ichiran/ Tokyu Hands/ Dotonbori etc. Would recommend 😊" .

Considering that it's a very new hotel, its hardware isn't that good. It's not at all eco-friendly! There wasn't a centralized light switch near the door so the lights and air conditioning would stay on unless you specifically head to the bedside table to switch them off. - The room was a good size. The location was excellent. You are right at the door step of the USJ. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from even if you prefer not to dine at the hotel. There were lots if shops that open late as well. It wasn't too noisy even though we were facing the main shopping area and close to the lift lobby. The same cannot be said of our uncivilized neighbors staying on the same floor. They spoke at the top of their voices at all hours." .

Room was a bit aged and unclean - there was mould in the air con vent in the room and side of our bathtub had cracks/holes in it. Toilet was a bit odd at times and made odd noises occasionally when in use. - Location was a good 8 min walk from the station. Rooms were definitely larger than other japanese hotels I've stayed at. Overall a decent hotel." .

The furniture (and the door lock as well - the screws were not tightened) was damaged here and there, the bath tub did not look clean, the A/C was switched off and still let the cold wind in. There were stains on the curtains, bathroom floor and on the table. The pipes were leaking when flushing and the light was blinking (going out at the moment one was taking a shower). Some of the pipes under the sink were fixed with duct tape though. The bed lining didn't look that bad, so we could sleep for a couple of hours. But we were not having good time since we were sick and had to sleep under the window insulated with towels. :( I wish the hotel management fixed the rooms since they've got really great staff and the hotel is located in the nice neighbourhood. - The staff is cheerful and kind.

For using Booking.com, we were given free drinks when we checked in, and the staff will also take orders for your breakfast to deliver to your room at a time of your choosing the next morning (you pay separately for all orders at the end of your stay). The breakfast was only 300 yen and it was delicious, much better than similar meals we ended up paying more for later on.

The hotel is very clean. We loved the lounge, it gives us the opportunity to meet up with other travellers. They have party every Monday and Thursday.

For Muslims, there is a very little space for prayer but might disturb other people to walk around the dormitory (we slept at a female dorm for 8). We still manage to pray, but should take turn.

But finally find out it's more convenient if most of the trip plan are within Osaka, since it's only two subway stations to Namba in one direction and another two stations to Umeda in the opposite direction. The food in hotel restaurant is nice too. I'll certainly consider to stay here again when visit Osaka." .

Word of advise, carry the instant Starbucks (or similar ) with you as most Japanese coffee is on the weak side. It was a great value." .

Really nice to soak in after a shower. - Location is convenient next to the JR Fukushima station (not the local one), so both KIX airport access and Osaka loop line access is easy. - Great value for money. - Great view on the top (23) floor." .

Breakfast and happy hours are fabulous in Floor 32. I think Hilton will be the only choice for us in the future.

The location was good (about a 10-15min walk from Namba/Dotonbori) and was close to the subway station which was on the same line as Shin-Osaka station so transfers to the Shinkansen were easy. There are also plenty of good local dining options around the hotel." .

When I filled the bathtub the first night, I discovered it had not been cleaned between the last guests and us (black hairs, but I'm blonde). 🤢 - Breakfast was worth the money. Tasty, convenient.

There’s quite a few dinning places nearby and they are opened until 9pm. The room was very clean and new bedroom slippers and bottled water were provided every day. The Jap breakfast provided was simple yet yummy and definitely filling since they provided a side buffet of toast, cereals, rice and miso soup. The dinning area was transformed to a family gathering area where we did origami with pretty papers provided by the hotel.

We asked for a quiet room, but unfortunately we could hear the upstairs floor banging and walking around which made it quite hard to sleep, also they had joined two beds together to try and make one large one which was also rather uncomfortable. The hotel hosted a wedding and that was also an issue for us as we were subjected to drunk people fighting in the hotel lobby to the point where the police were called. Even though this hotel has a good location, it wasn't value for money and I definitely wouldn't stay there again. We checked out early after one night and feel that for what we paid we had very much wasted our money on an unpleasant experience. - The location of the hotel was ideal, close to the nishiki markets, and some good shopping areas and taxi's are always waiting and available at the front of the hotel." .

But here is my main problem with Westin Osaka. We booked this hotel primarily because it had a swimming pool. This is our main form of exercise and something we tried to have where ever we booked. And everywhere we stayed that had a swimming pool we were grateful to be able to have that respite. However when we went to the Westin Osaka pool in the morning we were greeted with a fee to use the facilities, something I found just unacceptable. And the fee amounted to approx $45!!! As a guest paying top dollar to stay in the hotel i definitely do NOT expect to have no access to the hotels' pool. Just bloody ridiculous, and a little offensive given, as I've said, the top tariff paid to stay there. - Concierge was able to book our Shinkensan train to Tokyo for us and have the tickets ready to pick up at the concierge desk that night which took the stress out of doing this ourselves. They charged a pretty steep fee to do so but nonetheless it made our lives a little easier." .

        hip:hasText  "We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Osaka for one night in April. The experience was terrible and we will not return nor recommend it. When trying to modify our booking before our stay, the staff could not help and blamed booking.com, which booking.com was later able to ‘fix’. But upon arrival (11am – before check-in time) the changes to the reservation were not noted by the hotel and after 45min of discussing, we thought we had resolved and left our bags, and were told to return at 2pm for our keys. We returned at 3pm but our room was not ready, and to fill the time the staff argued with us about modifying the reservation (still apparently not noted correctly) and even claimed we had lied about the number of people and that one of us could not stay in the room. They showed us printouts in Japanese, which we could not read/translate, and pointed to sections supposedly showing our error of reserving a room for one adult and one child instead of two adults and would not allow another adult in the room. We kept asking them to honor the reservation and let us know what was needed as after traveling 45min from the train station and with a room already reserved, we intended to stay the night. They wanted us to re-reserve online, but of course that wasn’t much of an option as we would have been charged for multiple reservations, and eventually said that the additional cost of the second adult would be 3,000 yen which we agreed to. We felt bullied and berated. The manager refused to speak to us and stood in the next room relaying instruction to the check-in staff. After over an hour of discussion, the room was still not available, and we had to wait at the desk. - We switched gears once able to get to our room, and went upstairs to the 28th floor Bay Lounge for happy hour. The staff there was very friendly, respectful and courteous. The view and drinks/snacks were good and we even had our picture taken and printed by the maître d'hotel. We ordered room service, and took advantage of the table and chairs in our room. Based on the long commute from the train station and poor experience with the check-in staff and management, we will not return but the area, rooms, and some staff are very nice." .

This is due to the way the hotel and the surrounding buildings are set up. All windows are facing the sides of the hotel but due to the fact that it is sandwiched between two other buildings, which are about 2 meters apart (that's not much in building terms), there is no view and daylight does not really come into the room. However, given that this is mainly a business hotel and you usually are out sight seeing the above does not really take away from how good this hotel is. At least for me. One tip: To get from the Hommachi subway station to the hotel it says to take exit 25. However, I found that this can be a bit of a struggle with luggage as there are not always escalators so you would have to drag your luggage up and down the stairs. I used exit 5 of Hommachi station, only one set of stairs, and walked the rest of the way to the hotel above ground. It's better because it is all even ground and all you do is walk straight for about 10 minutes. - This was a great last minute find in Osaka. I am so glad I booked this hotel. I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of my holidays, which was a lovely start. When I booked my first stay I also wanted to book a second stay for the end of my holidays, but the hotel was booked out at the time. Luckily I checked booking.com during my stay several times and shortly before my return to Osaka there were rooms available again and I used my chance. I was so happy! It is the perfect non-nonsense, clean, modern, friendly staff hotel. I stayed in 7 different hotels during my 3 weeks in Japan in May and this hotel was the best of the lot. A quiet room which recently had been renovated. And speaking of renovation, during my second stay there was construction going on inside the hotel. The rooms on certain floors are currently being refurbished. According to the notice put up in the public areas of the hotel the works are scheduled until the middle of July. While it may an inconvenience now, it is nice to see that this hotel is getting a make over. The upper floor rooms I stayed in had been renovated already and it is absolutely worth it." .

That is however the biggest space you can get from the room itself. The lighting inside is poor. There was an odd smell coming from the drain area near the shower and I wouldn't want to be inside for long time. There was a dirty towel hanging on the rack which is quite oddly after they clean the room and I don't understand the reason behind that. Hotel security made it very inconvenient where they used a key system - a physical key and a key chain with the room number on it. They claimed to only have one key. You are supposed to turn your key to the reception every time you leave the hotel. - The location was excellent.

(pictures attached) This place is: - DIRTY Sheets were dirty, hairs everywhere in the bed and the matress was stained. The male showers are totally disgusting: made of wooden planks (!?), molded, and infested with little flies. - SMELLY The room smelt like pee and there were no windows in the room, or even in the rest of the building to aerate. - NOISY The rooms are just separated with a wooden planks, you can hear the other guests talking and moving around. On top of that the karaoke-bar next door played music until the middle of the night... - UNCOMFORTABLE The beds are ridiculously small, I'm only 174 cm tall, but I had to sleep my feet out of the frame. As for the matress... Just a thin futon lay flat on an plank. - UNSAFE Corridors and room's doors are narrows, electric cords are left hanging from the wall, there's nails sticking out of the walls, trash cans are in the middle of the way, ect... I also noticed a golf club placed right behind the entrance door. I didn't feel at ease. - INSANE When I calmly told the owner that the room didn't quite match my expectations (I was being polite...) he went mad and started to yell at me \"GET OUT! GET OUT!\" I wish I could, but he refused to give me back my money... Don't go there. - N/A" .

After the wash/dry cycles, my clothes were still wet (no, it wasn't overloaded). Since the wash and dry cycles cannot be run separately, my only choice would have been to run through both cycles again, with the likely outcome the same: wet clothes. This is a stupid idea! I complained, got my money back, and walked to a local laundromat, but anyone who plans on doing their wash here should beware! Also, I am allergic to many detergents, and in the last 3 years many hotel laundries, including the one here, have switched to washers that automatically add detergent (for only 100 yen extra!). This combined unit also adds detergent, whether you want it or not! Across the board, this is the worst problem I face as a traveler in Japan. - For the Osaka area the price is good, although the fact that a Kintetsu Rail ride is needed to reach it is a downer. From the Kintetsu station it's only a short walk. As at most Japanese hotels, the staff were excellent." .

We were not informed about any last orders, we were not even offered a coffee - we were just not allowed to enter the cafe. Absolutely not helpful and not understanding staff!

We had accidentally gone to the Shin-Osaka Station Hotel Annex, instead of Honkan, and the staff kindly brought us to where we were supposed to be. Very courteous and would greet us each time they saw us. We're a family of 4 adults, so we found our room a little bit cramped with 4 beds squeezed into it. There was however enough room to move around between the beds. What I liked was there were sockets conveniently located at the head of the beds. An iron would be provided should you need one, but you would have to go down to reception to get it yourself. Washing machines are available downstairs, and they are coin-operated. Breakfast was good. We chose the option of Japanese breakfast ( you can choose between Japanese and American) and for that we got the grilled fish of the day, a Japanese omelette, rice and miso soup. For the American breakfast, if I'm not mistaken, you would get 2 sandwiches, fruits and salad. There is a station for rice, soups, salads, yoghurt and drinks, which we were free to take as much as we liked. It is conveniently located near Shin-Osaka station, about a 5 minute walk away from the east exit. However, be aware that it is close to the JR and Shinkansen side of the station. Walking to and from the subway side takes much longer, as you have to walk all the way across to the west side, and it is a big station. Taking the central exit and using the pedestrian bridge to cross the railway tracks is a much faster option if you don't have your luggage with you. On the way from the station to the hotel, there is a Lawson's , so you could easily drop by." .

It was previously a \"weekly condo\" which are condos that Japanese business men use as a second home when they are working long hours at the office and can't make the treck back to their home in the suburbs. The rooms are similar to college dorms at best and the whole condo reminded me of a scene from a Japanese horror movie. Staff is not accommodating and will not give you extra towels or pillows, even for your children! You can get much more for you money elsewhere!!!! - Room was spacious & walking distance to Osaka castle. Hotel is 2 blocks away from subway station with connection to most major tourist attractions" .

First we thought it is cleaning agent as they just have finished cleaning and will go away with some aircon on. However, it was not the case - it smelled all the way to our departure. By that tine we were too lazy to change room, as packing and unpacking is not how we want to spend vacation. Should not happen. Then the last night when we had too wake up early, - there was some slight banging (drop- like) sound from upstairs. We were offered to move, - it was not reasonable way of action at 3am with 3-4 hours until we leave hotel for good. So we slept about 2 hours that night. As explanation we got that maybe some water piping above is not tight and the water is dripping in between the floors. Rest of things: smoking. Only inside smoking facilities, which are crammed and poorly ventilated. After asking for directions to nearest outside smoking place, I never got a real answer. The one I got was: you can smoke outside next to our sign but there is no ashtray. Elevators: for such hotel there should be at least one dedicated elevator. Time to time one can spend up to 10 min to get to reception from downstairs. Location: I would choose this place again only for one night stay before the flight as connection to airport by direct train is excellent. Next time will be Swissotel for me in Osaka, with more central location and lower price tag. - The view was one and only thing which was excellent. 51st floor." .

The luxury room was on the 27th floor which gave great views across the river and included the Tempozan wheel which is nicely lit up at night. We arrived at the hotel a little early but was still not allowed to the room untill the 3pm checkin time. Bags can be left at a storage room until checkin time. In the time we had before checkin we decided to visit the aquarium and Tempozan wheel. Our room had 2x small double beds and was spacious. The room was still very clean. Toilet was seperate from the bathroom and had the all singing all butt washing state of the art Japanese toilet. The heated seat I will be missing very much..The bathroom was a wet room with shower and high sided bath. Still in very clean condition with no mould in the grouting. The shower and bath were easy to use. Every day there was fresh toiletries for you to use including Shampoo, conditioner, Shower gel (all by laura ashley), toothpaste, toothbrushes, hair bands, combs, bath salts, face clenser, hand soap, razor, shave foam, relaxing foot pads (for after walking around USJ) cotton buds, fabric deodorizer.... pretty much all you need so you dont have to worry to much about the toiletries yoy bring! A big flat screen tv was in the room but we never used it. A fridge is included with 2x free small bottles of water everyday. A coffee maching with 2 free coffee pods are given everyday. 2x soups and teas are also provided. The hotel staff were fantastically friendly and helpfull in all our needs. Most of them speak and understand good english which helped a lot for us to get to destinations other than USJ. You can book USJ tickets at the hotel but we decided to purchase tickets online in advance. There is a buffet meals served throughout the day but we decided to eat in different places to suit our daily plans." .

The bathroom is modern and clean. Specially loved the \"Handy\" Travel Buddy gadget that is free for use during our entire stay." .

Before I left England I phoned up to ask about the possibility of checking in early as I knew I would be knackered after the flight. They said it was possible to check in at 1pm but I would have to pay 4000 yen. I thought this was a bit mean but was glad there was that option. However when I got there at about midday that option was not available. I was on my own in a strange land out of my mind with tiredness and I had to wait 3 hours to get into the room to sleep. It was horrible! I can't believe they can't be more flexible..If guests have to check out at 11am there must be some rooms ready early. It seems that they would rather stick rigidly to the rules than be kind to their guests. The only other con was that the room was TINY. The smallest we stayed in in Japan. You could not even walk around the bed. But the bed was nice and big at least. - The location is excellent and very convenient..right in the exciting cool part of town. The bed was really big and comfy. Free ramen in the evening were nice and onsen facilities I didn't use (I have tattoos plus you have to be naked!) But my partner went to see and said it looked really nice. There is a shop attached to the hotel which was really handy and means you don't have to get breakfast at the hotel." .

The Life store also has an amazing range of bento boxes to grab for a cheap lunch/dinner which you can heat up at the store or back at the hotel. Hotel is close walking distance to Namba Parks." .

The staff is extremely nice, they even brought us umbrellas when they saw that we headed out the door without any, because they knew it would rain that day. The room we stayed in was spacious, modern and clean. When we put the do not disturb sign on our door, the cleaners left a bag with all the bathroom supplies hanging on the outside handle so we had fresh towels etc. every day. The breakfast was good with tons of options for both food and drinks, and was true to the picture on their page. There are also two vending machines in the lobby hallway, one for drinks and one for snacks. We booked a room for three people and had a room with two twin beds and a pull-out couch, which was just as comfortable as the beds! The bathroom was very nice with a top-of-the-line automated toilet, a separate space for the shower and even a small bathtub. The hotel is located about a 15-minute walk from Namba Station, and the Nankai Line to Kansai Airport. There is also a subway stop about a 5-minute walk away and a JR-line stop for the Osaka Loop Line less than 10 minutes away. The surrounding area is safe, there is a police station almost across the street and three small convenience stores (Lawson's and 7/Eleven) on the way from the Daikokucho Subway Station. We didn't see many restaurants around the area, but we mostly ate when we were out in town so we didn't explore the hotel area that much. Overall this hotel exceeded my expectations with its cleanliness, amenities and above all, its amazing staff! I'll definitely stay here again when I return to Osaka!" .

I didn't want to travel anymore. We had to stay in a smoking room for a night before they moved us to another floor which was our requested non smoking floor/room. They also compensated us with breakfast vouchers for the booboo. - The breakfast counter are amazing. Dedicated chef to cook your food from eggs, to waffles and etc. Extremely good location if you are travelling to other destinations via trains or even subway. It is located extremely near the local subway and a McDonalds. The location is a winner. We took Haruka Express from Kansai Airport to Shin Osaka station and later on to Kyoto. Easy breeze." .

If it were a small hotel we would understand that they haven't prepared the room, but in such a big hotel with so many rooms they could have given us one already. Because the hotel is so big, everything is conventional and the staff is a too much formal. - The situation was good, near the Osaka Station, but we got lost more than one time trying to go out of the station and getting to the hotel. The hotel is very big and the halls look very nice, the room is big (for Japan) and clean. They give you the option of not changing the towels if you want to help the environment, and you can donate money for reforestation. You have a small fridge in the room, a boiler, some glasses and cups, tea and coffee. The bed was ok, comfortable. The toilet is a japanese one-piece bathroom. You can use the air-conditioning but temperature in the room was ok. No insect netting in the window, but it was high, so there was no need of it. It was quiet. You can have breakfast in the hotel for 800Yen, but in the station are lots of restaurants where you can have a coffee, tea and some pastries for much less. At night you can walk around the streets near the hotel, there are lots of shops, bars and restaurants. 5 minutes walking in the Osaka Station you can take the airport limousine bus, we took it to the Kansai International Airport and it was perfect, just be in time, because a lot of people use it and maybe you won't get place at your first attempt." .

They do also provide free ramen every nights for all guests." .

The concierge was always ready to help with directions to attractions and provided maps highlighting the routes and provided great recommendations. The suite we stayed in was spacious with a full kitchen which had a washer/dryer in addition to a dish washer. Bathroom was also a great size with a tub and full room shower. The toilet was in a separate room with its own sink. We had a dining table and couch area with a nice view from 29th floor. Bed was quite comfortable with an incredible Bose system that included speaks in the bathroom. Hotel is located in the enormous Grand Front Mall with access to many shops, restaurants, cafes and bakeries." .

I must say - the map on Booking.com of how to get there from Shin-Osaka station is horrible.

They drew maps for us and looked up restaurants to ensure that they were open before we went because it was a holiday. The location was good. It is right on the subway and there were lots of restaurants close by. The Osaka Castle grounds are only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. The beds were nice, but the pillows were a little hard. I wasn't able to get channels on the TV, but the remote was in Japanese, so I probably didn't hit the right button. Wifi was excellent though if you wanted to watch something that way. The water pressure was perfect and the hot water was very nice. The air con took some time to cool off the room, but worked great." .

Confusing water tap temperature adjustment. Dryer laundry price were not flat, it depends how long you need to use. - The location is great. Good value. Adjustable brightness lamp in the room." .

One staff was kind of rude and unhelpful when I try to get rid of some rubbish left in the room the day before because we forget to put up the \"Clean The Room\" notice. I brought it to the kitchen on my own initiative so as not to trouble the staff...but a staff on finding me loitering in the kitchen was grumpy and rude towards me for intrusion into their 'No Entry' area. Rattled off something in Japanese, which from tone and body language was clearly displaying his displeasure with me. The other gripe is about the breakfast provided. The spread of food given was kind of quite limited and pathetic, though what was given do taste great. If not for a good location and some friendly helpful staff still around, I would definitely mark this hotel off my 'visit again' destination. - The location and access to train stations as well as OCAT (Osaka City Air Terminal) Limousine Bus Service to the airport was really good. The SPA available on the 6th floor was a great experience for 500yen each nite when we come back after an exhaustive visit to various places of interest in the day." .

I personally think this place is still really cool and felt safe walking alone on midnight. There were some homeless people on the roadside but i assure you they are all nice and warm people like most of Japanese people. I super loved their spa/public bath as well,it was my first time to be on a public bath and was too shy at first hahaha.. try it, it's a great way to relax after a long tiring day! I stayed in ladies' floor and the toilet there was always clean. Staff are all friendly and warm. Clean towels everyday, just ask from the reception. Free coffee in the morning. They sell cakes and cup noodles and has vending machines inside so no worries if u get hungry but feeling lazy to go to convenience store. Direct train from KIX to Shin Imamiya One of the cheapest in Shin Imamiya, i think. Can use their bikes for free, can borrow umbrella too. Will stay there again. Recommended for solo travelers!

Two were drunk, snored all night long and farted. Someone was listening to loud music in the room at 10:30am.

Then having to leave the fan heating on 24 hours a day becuase they room went cold fast made our skin and eyes all dried out. Having to stand there and check in ourselves on a computer when there is a staff standing there watching you check in. Couldn't they just do it for us?..... It would have been faster for everyone else in the que. Not letting us check in any earlier and then having a flood of people line up all at the same time to check in. Our floor was so dirty from the start, blonde hairs all over the place. A dirty sock sticking out from under the bed. They gave us two flat looking outdoor plastic pillows to sleep on. Had to request more pillows. Never having the option of having our sheets changed becuase they want to save water. Fair enough but there should be a choice! There's no safe in the room so we tried leaving your passports in reception. The staff didn't understand what I wanted when I handed him my passports. He tried to hand me someone elses passport.

The amenities provided were great, I didn't need to use any of my own toiletries apart from deodorant as this was all provided. The room light fixtures and air conditioner was all managed by a panel at the beside table. You was able to put a 'Do Not Disturb' on your room without leaving your bed.

Technically you share a room with up to 14 people, however several compartments can be closed off from the others so it feels like the rooms are smaller. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very good, with showers and toilets that offer more privacy than in some other hostels. I also really liked the common area on the 6th floor, where the hotel also provides free drinks & snacks every monday & thursday evening. Overall there was a nice atmosphere and it was definitely a comfortable place to stay in as a backpacker. The location is also very good for exploring the city with public transport or walking." .

There are limited dinner options (McDonalds, Curry Place, Octopus balls, 7Eleven, small traditional place) but definitely enough to get you through if your tired from venturing out all day. Showers had excellent water pressure." .

        hip:hasText  "The only downside were roommates often kept the shared spaces untidy, but it's to be expected when sharing with 7 other girls. Thankfully, daily housekeeping reduced staying in dirty environments for too long. - If it wasn't for the bunk beds, I could have easily mistaken my stay here as being at a 3.5 star hotel, with its modern amenities and pristine cleanliness on all floors. The complementary drinks and snacks on Mondays and Thursdays were a great ice breaker to meet fellow travellers. Staff speak both English and Japanese, so it's easy to get assistance when needed. Beds were larger and more comfortable than expected, and almost daily room service cleanings before lunch were a nice touch to shared living spaces. Located close to Tanimachi-kyu-chome station, it is in an ideal location for those looking to travel to major tourist spots. A definite value for the dollar!" .

The laundry room is only available from 7am till 10pm. This is not very convenient for tourists as i would have to be up at 7am every few days to get my laundry done. The apartment should consider upgrading the access to the laundry room to allow access via room card so that guests can wash their laundry any time of the day. If you are travelling with some elderly folks, they may have some problems \"climbing\" in/out the bath tubs to bath as the tubs are really high. The wall plugs in my room are located in all the weird corners of the room. There isn't a wall plug anywhere near the table. - The apartment is really close to Daikokucho Station, 5 to 10mins walking distance. There is also a 24h supermarket round the corner. 7-11 is also within few mins walk away. For solo travellers, the single person room is very spacious. However, the twin bedroom (with sofa) is a bit of a squeeze, leaving both occupants with no space to open luggages. Staff are very friendly and fluent in English. There is also a lady whom did the checkin for me, she is fluent in Chinese as well. Do note that this is not a hotel, so there are no daily housekeeping services. For those reviewers who had left bad reviews about the lack of housekeeping and having to bring out their own rubbish, they probably didn't read carefully prior to booking. The apartment do provide me with 1 housekeeping service as i was staying more than 10 days. Overall the rooms are well maintained though the furniture looks quite \"antique\". I would recommend this accommodation for travellers who are on a budget." .

The hotel has four elevators; however, only two go above the 7th floor where the front desk is located! Noisy Chinese tourists kept us up every night. The hotel did nothing to resolve this. I guess keeping Chinese tourists happy was more important then keeping Japanese customers happy. - The price was extremely reasonable.
