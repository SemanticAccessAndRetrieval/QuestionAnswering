Location could be better - it's convenient, but not right in the thick of the action. Could use more electric outlets and tech perks like Handy phone or in room entertainment (eg Netflix or at least a way to plug into the TV via HDMI), Solid hotel but not the best offerings or value out there. Clearly aimed at business rather than leisure/romantic travelers.
