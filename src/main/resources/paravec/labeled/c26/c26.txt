Bathroom is very clean and neat. View is excellent, in a clear day you can see Mt Fuji, night view is breathtaking as well. I can spend the whole day stay in front of the window looking at the tower :-) staffs are very friendly and helpful. Their English is fluent. There is a magical clock outside of the building. Anyway I gave this place 10/10.
