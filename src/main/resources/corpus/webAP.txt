1;;1959-72, a period of increasing production and low prices
10;;The following factors stand out as major forces that created change in the oil and gas industry between 1980 and 2000: 1) increasing volatility of prices, 2) rising costs of oil and gas projects, 3) globalization of the industry, 4) increased concern for shareholder value, 5) ascendance of technology, and 6) management of risk.
100;;New businesses and economic venues will be created as a result which will offer new opportunities for farmers and people in rural and disadvantaged economic areas.
1000;;Maryland's Tributary Teams meet regularly in each of the Bay's ten major tributaries to help implement pollution prevention measures needed to address local water quality problems.
1001;;Led efforts to construct the Poplar Island Restoration Project, the largest habitat restoration project ever undertaken in the Chesapeake Bay.
1002;;Won authorization and funding to begin this restoration project utilizing dredged materials from Port of Baltimore shipping channels to restore wetlands and recreate habitat for one of the Bay's most valuable island ecosystems.
1003;;Authored legislation, now included in public law, establishing an Army Corps of Engineers pilot program to assist with sediment and erosion control, protection of eroding shorelines, beneficial uses of dredged material, and other related projects that enhance the estuary's living resources.
1004;;Sponsored successful amendments to the Clean Air Act and Farm Bill of 1990 to designate the Chesapeake Bay as a priority area for research and conservation activities.
1005;;More than doubled the funding for Federal agencies involved in the Chesapeake Bay restoration project
1006;;Maryland defines the boundary of its Coastal Zone as the inland boundary of the counties bordering the Atlantic Ocean, Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River, as far as the municipal limits of Washington, D.C., and includes 16 of the State's 23 counties and Baltimore City.
1007;;The Maryland CZM Program coordinates multi-year, multiagency initiatives that provide a framework for statewide and watershed-specific water quality, coastal hazards, public access and habitat restoration efforts.
1008;;A proposal seeking additional funds for use in other watersheds has been forwarded to the EPA for consideration.
1009;;If successful, this proposal will cover 75 percent of the purchase and installation costs of the following items: 4 fish cleaning stations equipped with garbage disposals and sanitary sewer connections; 4 recycling pressure washing systems; 4 vacuum sanders or grinders; 4 shoreside buffers planted with native plants; 2 oil and antifreeze recycling stations; and 2 high-volume, low-pressure spray guns.
101;;American pearls might substitute for imports-primarily from Japan - currently worth over $400 million
1010;;Each state is required to establish and maintain a CPP for water quality management as described under Section 303(e) of the CWA.
1011;;Maryland's CPP provides a description of the processes the State uses to administer its water programs and to develop plans to protect, maintain, and improve the quality of the State's waters.
1012;;Chesapeake Bay Program: Direct and enhance State water quality program efforts in support of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.
1013;;Maximize the use of federal resources available for Bay cleanup efforts.
1014;;Point Source Pollution: Ensure levels of wastewater treatment that will allow compliance with established water quality standards and will permit attainment of recognized beneficial uses for the State's waters.
1015;;Highlighting the results-oriented emphasis of the Bay Program, the Executive Council guided the restoration effort in 1993 with five directives addressing key areas of the restoration, including the tributaries, toxics, underwater bay grasses, fish passages, and agricultural nonpoint source pollution.
1016;;Specifically, the Executive Council directed the partners to outline initiatives for nutrient reduction in the bay's tributaries; revise the Basinwide Toxics Reduction Strategy by 1994; develop action plans to address problems related to toxics in specific geographic areas within the watershed; and work with the agricultural community to implement total resource management programs on farms in the watershed.
1017;;In addition, the Executive Council set an initial goal for recovery of bay grasses at 114,000 acres by the year 2005 and set five (582 miles) and ten-year (1,350 miles) goals for reopening upstream spawning habitat for migratory fish by removing blockages, such as small dams, on the bay's tributaries.
1018;;The Executive Council also signed the Riparian Forest Buffers Initiative in 1996, which increased the Bay Program's commitment to improve water quality and enhance habitat.
1019;;The new goal calls for restoring 2,010 miles of riparian buffers on streams and shorelines in the watershed by the year 2010.
102;;If anything that grows in water is not yet in commercial culture, it at least is being considered for aquaculture, and methods are being developed for its culture.
1020;;Exotic species: A species of snail- the Veined Rapa Whelk- was discovered in the summer of 1998 in the bay near Hampton Roads, Virginia.
1021;;Studies are being conducted to learn more about this native of the Sea of Japan.
1022;;Oyster habitat: As of December 1998, Maryland and Virginia had met or exceeded goals to designate 11,000 acres of bay bottom as aquatic reef habitat.
1023;;Bay Partner Communities: The Chesapeake Bay Partner Communities Program recognized 16 communities that took significant steps in protecting local natural resources and the Chesapeake in 1998.
1024;;Science: The Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee has launched Chesapeake Futures- a team of experts looking at issues related to the Bay's possible health in the year 2030.
1025;;Minimize adverse impacts on water quality that result from pollutants that are discharged from structures or conveyances that have run off from surrounding lands
1026;;Conserve fish, wildlife, and plant habitat in the Critical Area; and
1027;;Establish land use policies for development in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area which accommodate growth and also address the fact that, even if pollution is controlled, the number, movement, and activities of persons in an area can create adverse environmental impacts.
1028;;The Chesapeake Bay Program has developed a Tributary Strategy that sets goals for nutrient reductions in major river basins that make up the Bay ecosystem.
1029;;To meet those goals, nutrient and toxic runoff will have to be severely curtailed from many sources.
103;;The list runs the gamut from abalone, alligator, and baitfishes, through crayfishes, geoducks, lobsters, mahi mahi, pearl oysters, and ornamental seahorses, to seaweeds, sponges, scallops, and sturgeons
1030;;While farms constitute a major source of nutrients to the Bay, through runoff and groundwater seepage, state programs, Cooperative Extension Service agencies, and soil conservation districts in the Chesapeake Bay watershed are working with farmers in numerous programs to encourage voluntary reduction of fertilizer and pesticide use and control of soil erosion.
1031;;In Backyard Actions for a Cleaner Chesapeake Bay-a public education outreach program-the Maryland Department of Agriculture, the Maryland Sea Grant College Program, the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service, and Maryland farmers joined together in a program in Spring and Summer 1995 to begin educating citizens on practical actions they could take on their lawns and gardens to help protect the Chesapeake Bay.
1032;;Operators of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs qualify for Clean Marina certification by adopting measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management.
1033;;To date, 110 boating facilities have taken the first step and signed the Clean Marina Pledge.
1034;;Of these, 25 marinas have been certified as Clean Marinas and one public boat ramp has been certified as a Clean Marina Partner.
1035;;Additionally, the blended approach of employing both voluntary and regulatory programs to carry out the Bay Agreement allows each state's environmental, natural resource and planning agencies to work together in a positive atmosphere and encourages them to put aside political, geo-physical and cultural differences to solve the excessive nitrogen problem
1036;;Certified Clean Marinas demonstrate that business and environmental interests can be compatible, said Clean Marina Coordinator, Elizabeth Fuller Valentine.
1037;;They improve their bottom line and the quality of our waterways by voluntarily exceeding environmental regulations.
1038;;So far, 129 entities have taken the pledge.
1039;;There are approximately 600 boating facilities in Maryland and the CMIs goal is to certify 150 of those as Clean Marinas or Clean Marina Partners by 2004.
104;;There is some U.S. production of saltwater pearls.
1040;;The Clean Marina Partner designation recognizes boating facilities other than marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs that are implementing pollution prevention measures.
1041;;For example, Philip Conner, owner of Crockett Brothers, is working with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to raise oysters on a float suspended from a pier.
1042;;After tending to the oysters for about a year, the young oysters are transplanted to a non-harvested bed where they help to filter the Chesapeake Bay
1043;;A major focus of their efforts is controlling nutrient pollution from farm fields and horse pastures, wastewater treatment plants, construction and road building activities, and hundreds of thousands of suburban properties.
1044;;Among the pollution control options being implemented in each tributary basin are upgrades to wastewater treatment plants, the planting of stream-side forests to absorb nutrient runoff, best management practices to reduce agricultural runoff and "smart growth" plans aimed at concentrating new development and protecting open spaces and natural habitat.
1045;;This coordinated watershed-by-watershed approach brings the Bay cleanup closer to home for the many citizens, businesses and local governments working to protect local waterways and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay
1046;;Succeeded in getting a moratorium on all oil and gas drilling lease sales near the mouth of the Bay.
1047;;In June 2000, the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council unveiled Chesapeake 2000, a new Bay agreement to guide Bay restoration efforts into the 21^st century.
1048;;The agreement contains more than 100 individual commitments ranging from restoring the blue crab fishery, to preserving 20 percent of the watershed's resource lands, to removing the Bay from the EPA's list of impaired waters.
1049;;Fish passage: Through 1998, completion of fish passage projects had opened a total of 635 miles of bay tributaries.
105;;Abalone from along the Pacific Coast, primarily California, produce both blister and free pearls and their shells are used for inlay in jewelry and other items.
1050;;In 2003, the goal is for Bay Program partners to open 1,357 miles for migratory fish to reach spawning areas.
1051;;Since its inception in 1983, the Bay Program's highest priority has been the restoration of the bay's living resources- its finfish, shellfish, submerged grasses, and other aquatic life and wildlife.
1052;;Improvements include fisheries and habitat restoration, recovery of bay grasses, nutrient and toxics reductions, and significant advances in estuarine science.
1053;;The Bay Program has initiated many actions including a watershed-wide phosphate detergent ban, the introduction of agricultural best management practices (BMPs), biological nutrient removal at wastewater plants, and a public education campaign emphasizing the role each of the watershed's 15 million residents play in the restoration.
1054;;Bay underwater grasses: The total acreage of bay grasses has increased to more than 69,000 in the region.
1055;;The Bay Program's goal is to reach 114,000 acres in 2005.
1056;;Fish passage: Through 1998, completion of fish passage projects had opened a total of 635 miles of bay tributaries.
1057;;In 2003, the goal is for Bay Program partners to open 1,357 miles for migratory fish to reach spawning areas.
1058;;Pfiesteria: As of December 1998, Maryland, Virginia, and federal agencies had made more funds available for the research and monitoring of Pfiesteria which was linked to fish kills in 1997.
1059;;Forests: In 1998, the conservation organization American Forests partnered with the Bay Program and kicked off the Global ReLeaf for the Chesapeake campaign to plant one million trees in the bay region by 2000.
106;;The pearls are green, blue-green, yellow, or pink in color and may have high luster, but the texture is always coarser than that of other pearls.
1060;;Chemical releases: The latest data confirm that industries showed a 67 percent reduction in toxic releases to the Bay between 1988 and 1996.
1061;;Pollution Prevention: A Bay Program survey of farmers found that Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is practiced on 61 percent of bay area cropland.
1062;;The Bay Program's goal is to have this pollution prevention technique practiced on 75 percent of bay region cropland by 2000.
1063;;Businesses for the Bay: More than 222 million pounds of waste were either reduced or recycled in 1998 by members of Businesses for the Bay- the Bay Program's voluntary pollution prevention program for bay area businesses.
1064;;Land, growth and stewardship: The Bay Program funded three workshops in 1998 on sustainable development to provide a regional communication network for land and growth issues.
1065;;A watershed-wide summit called "Toward a Sustainable Chesapeake" was held March 22-23, 1999.
1066;;The Critical Area Law also requires that each local jurisdiction identify and provide for the establishment, preservation, and maintenance of Habitat Protection Areas.
1067;;These areas include: naturally vegetated 100-foot buffer (the Buffer); nontidal wetlands; the habitats of threatened and endangered species, and species in need of conservation, and their habitat; significant plant and wildlife habitat; and, anadromous fish-spawning areas.
1068;;Notable achievements towards meeting the 40 percent reduction have been made, for instance, through such actions as the banning of phosphorus detergents and through the upgrading of sewage treatment plants to remove phosphorus and, more selectively, nitrogen.
1069;;In addition, the federal Clean Water and Clean Air Acts have led to significant reductions in direct discharges of contaminants from industrial processes as well.
107;;Some of the pearls are very large, as large as 60 carats each.
1070;;Each of the 35 Clean Marinas has implemented measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair, petroleum storage and transfer, sewage disposal, solid, liquid and hazardous wastes, stormwater runoff, and facilities management.
1071;;A major function of law-enforcement and driver-licensing agencies will be to identify and regulate those drivers who do not self-regulate, i.e., those who continue to drive in situations in which they pose safety risks.
1072;;To assist licensing agencies in establishing appropriate regulatory approaches, the Agency will determine the characteristics of drivers that do not adequately self-regulate and the conditions, if any, under which they may be able to drive while preserving safety

1586;;Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) continued to be involved in the planning and support of terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use terrorism to pursue their goals.
1587;;, Iran continued to provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist groups -- notably HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the PFLP-GC -- with varying amounts of funding, safe haven, training, and weapons.
1588;;It also encouraged Hizballah and the rejectionist Palestinian groups to coordinate their planning and to escalate their activities.
1589;;Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups.

1600;;'Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties.
1601;;Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings.'
1602;;'The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decision making.
1603;;A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately

1615;;Courts ruled early that the executive had a right to withhold documents that might reveal military or state secrets
1616;;The courts have also granted the executive a right to withhold the identity of government informers in some circumstances, Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 59-61 (1957), and a qualified right to withhold information related to pending investigations.

1619;;The most frequent form of executive privilege raised in the judicial arena is the deliberative process privilege; it allows the government to withhold documents and other materials that would reveal "advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which govern- mental decisions and policies are formulated."
162;;Around the turn of the 20th century, pearls were harvested for jewelry, while Wabash River mussel shells were cut and finished into mother-of-pearl buttons and knife handles.
1620;;The executive privilege recognizes the need to protect open discussions among governmental officials and their staff:A fundamental part of the decisional process is the analysis of different options and alternatives.
1621;;Advisory communications, from a subordinate to a governmental officer, which examine and analyze these choices, are often essential to this process.
1622;;The making of candid communications by the subordinate may well be hampered if their contents are expected to become public knowledge.
1623;;To ensure more informed decisionmaking, the privilege protects confidential advisory and deliberative communications between government officials at all levels of government and those who assist them in formulating and deciding upon future governmental action.
1624;;"[e]xecutive privilege is the government's privilege to prevent disclosure of certain information whose disclosure would be contrary to the public interest" and that police investigations "are made under a veil of confidentiality and that it would contravene the public interest and would impair the functioning of the police department if the results of such investigations were disclosed."
1625;;When Congress directs its investigatory powers at Executive Branch departments and agencies, and at times at the White House itself, such probes have often become contentious, provoking the Executive to assert rights to shield from disclosure information Congress deems essential to carry out its oversight functions.
1626;;The variety of grounds proffered are often lumped in an undifferentiated manner under the rubric "executive privilege".
1627;;This would be a protective assertion of executive privilege designed to ensure the President's ability to make a final decision, after consultation with the Attorney General, as to which specific documents are deserving of a conclusive claim of executive privilege

1647;;Courts have recognized a presumptive privilege for presidential communications that is grounded in a Presidents generalized interest in confidentiality and is viewed as important to preserving the candor of presidential advisors and protecting the freedom of the president and his advisors to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.
1648;;According to a recent D.C. Circuit case, [t]he President can invoke the privilege when asked to produce documents or other materials that reflect Presidential decision making and deliberations and that the President believes should remain confidential.
1649;;As to the scope of this privilege, the court found, in the context of the criminal proceeding, it to cover communications made by presidential advisers in the course of preparing advice for the President, . . . even when these communications are not made directly to the President.
165;;The Japanese cultured pearl industry discovered that shell bits of several types of Wabash River mussels made ideal "seeds" for growing cultured pearls in marine pearl oysters -- and the harvest began anew.
1650;;The executive privilege may also be construed broadly to permit the government to protect documents that would reveal advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.
1651;;The general principle of executive privilege had been established because the President could refuse papers "the disclosure of which would injure the public."
1652;;The injury had to be to the public, not to the President or his associates
1653;;The Supreme Court has recognized the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking.
1654;;When the District Court denied the motion, the president appealed and the case was quickly brought to the Supreme Court.
1655;;In the following portion of the Court's unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court dealt with two key issues, the power of the judiciary as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution, and the claim of the president that, in the name of executive privilege, he could choose to withhold materials germane to a criminal investigation.

1658;;Historically, apart from and prior to the Constitution, the privilege against disclosure to the public . . . arises from the undisputed privilege that not all public business can be transacted completely in the open, that public officials are entitled to the private advice of their subordinates and to confer among themselves privately and frankly, without fear of disclosure, otherwise the advice received and the exchange of views may not be as frank and honest as the public good requires.
1659;;The cases uniformly rest the privilege on the policy of protecting the 'decision making process of government agencies' (citation omitted), and focus on documents 'reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.'
166;;To date, 31 different States have reported production of freshwater pearls and shell.
1660;;This privilege protects the 'consultative functions' of government by maintaining the confidentiality of 'advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated' (citations omitted).

1664;;E]xecutive privilege permits the President to keep secret confidential communications between him and his aides and even confidential communications among his aides which are had for the purpose of aiding the President to perform in a lawful manner his official duties.
1665;;It is well established that executive privilege applies to confidential communications to the President.
1666;;The first is the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties; the importance of this confidentiality is too plain to require further discussion.
1667;;Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decision-making process.
1668;;Here it is argued that the independence of the Executive Branch within its own sphere insulates a President from a judicial subpoena in an ongoing criminal prosecution, and thereby protects confidential Presidential communications.

1672;;Executive privilege may properly be asserted in response to a congressional subpoena seeking testimony by the Counsel to the President concerning the performance of official duties on the basis that the Counsel serves as an immediate adviser to the President and is therefore immune from compelled congressional testimony.
1673;;Documents reflecting and constituting deliberative communications within the White House Counsel's Office and between that Office and the Department of Justice relating to advice and recommendations to the President on the assertion of executive privilege are themselves a proper subject of a claim of executive privilege.
1674;;Executive privilege is assertable in response to a congressional subpoena seeking the testimony of the Counsel to the President because the Counsel serves as one of the President's immediate advisers and is therefore immune from compelled congressional testimony.
1675;;Executive privilege may properly be asserted with respect to certain White House Counsel's Office documents that have been subpoenaed by the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of Representatives in connection with the Committee's investigation of the White House Travel Office matter
1676;;During the 1992 election, President George Bush came under scrutiny for his role as vice-president during the Iran-contra scandals.
1677;;Bush claimed to be "out of the loop" about the arms deal.
1678;;Democratic candidate Bill Clinton made Bush's role a central issue in his run for the White House.
1679;;Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore, referred to notes released by an aide to former Secretary of State George Shultz that belied Bush's claim.
168;;The bulk of the shell and pearl production came from Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana.
1680;;As the campaign drew to a close, more information linked Bush to the scandal.
1681;;One of Bush's last acts as president was his issuance of pardons to Iran-contra figures who had been indicted, pled guilty or been found guilty
1682;;It was also in trouble, beset by charges of illegal activity arising out of the Iran-Contra scandal.
1683;;Moreover, Webster's DDCI, Robert Gates, whom the inexperienced DCI required for analytical support and expertise, was himself suspected of being at least implicitly involved in the Iran-Contra affair.
1684;;Appearing on television, Reagan said forcefully, We did not, repeat not, trade weapons or anything else for hostages.'
1685;;When this was proven to be untrue, he later made a carefully worded retraction.
1686;;He left it to Attorney General Meese to disclose the diversion of arms-sales funds to Nicaraguan contra rebels, a violation of an act of Congress
1687;;As the Iran-Contra scandals grew, a Reagan-appointed commission headed by former Senator John Tower held hearings.
1688;;President Ronald Reagan told the Tower Commission that (A) He did not know the National Security Council staff had been helping the contras; (B) he had "no definite knowledge of military aid"; and (C) "I was very definitely involved in decisions about the freedom fighters.
1689;;It was my idea to begin with."
169;;For the past several years, production in the pearl industry has declined because of reduced demand for pearls.
1690;;His task was made easier by the Tower Commission Report which, while not uncritical of the CIA, made it clear that the Iran-Contra affair was a National Security Council initiative and that the Agency as an institution--as opposed to the actions of specific individuals--was not involved.
1691;;The approved Fiscal Year 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act^26 contains a series of new provisions for reporting on covert action.
1692;;These include the requirements: that the President's findings be in writing and not retroactive, that all government agencies and entities (not just the CIA) be clearly covered, and that Congress be informed if a third party or another country might become involved (under the revised version of the Act, this party or country does not have to be named.).
1693;;During the 1980s, Congress also limited the president's expenditure of funds, this time in Central America.
1694;;It was a violation of this policy by officials of the Reagan administration that led to the Iran-Contra scandal involving the sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits from the sale to the Contras in Nicaragua, and resulted in criminal charges being brought against two national security aides who broke the law.
1695;;These helped to produce changes in executive procedures for covert action, to amend statutory reporting requirements in this field, and to install a statutory office of inspector general in the CIA
1696;;The T-cell count can vary, depending on such differences as the time of day and the test was done, what laboratory did the test, and whether certain health problems were present the day the blood was drawn.
1697;;A trend of decreasing white cell, red cell, or platelet indices in an individual over time is more worrisome than an isolated abnormal finding at one test time
1698;;What abnormal results mean Low numbers of WBCs (leukopenia) may indicate: * bone marrow failure (for example, due to infection, tumor, fibrosis) * presence of cytotoxic substance * collagen-vascular diseases (such as lupus erythematosus) * disease of the liver or spleen * radiation
1699;;HIV binds to the surface of CD4 cells, enters them, and either reproduces immediately killing them in the process, or remains in a resting state, reproducing when the cell becomes active.
17;;There was also little incentive to employ more sophisticated, expensive, and labor-intensive production techniques for recovering oil.
170;;Pearl oysters are grown using hanging culture techniques, where oysters seeded with pearl forming nuclei are hung in baskets from lines supported by buoys, and utilize natural ocean productivity as food.
1700;;Despite these fluctuations, in most people the CD4 count will decrease gradually over many years.
1701;;In general, the CD4 count tends to be a little lower in the morning and higher in the evening.
1702;;Your CD4 count may also be affected by acute illness, such as herpes simplex virus infection, which could cause the count to decline temporarily.
1703;;HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, directly infects and damages T cells.
1704;;Because of this, in most people infected with HIV the number of T cells decreases as time passes.
1705;;Some medicines, such as steroids prescribed for asthma or PCP, may also cause the T-cell count to be lower than it would be otherwise.
1706;;It is known that the HIV virus invades the CD4+ cell and makes the cell ineffective in doing its normal functions.
1707;;After infection with HIV, there is an initial decline in CD4+ cells followed by a return to near normal levels, with a gradual decline over an extended period.
1708;;Neutrophils die continuously from age or from fighting infections, and your bone marrow must make new neutrophils to replace them.When something reduces production of neutrophils in your bone marrow, the neutrophil count will drop and may become dangerously low.
1709;;Prescription medications, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim, Septra), ganciclovir, zidovudine (AZT), interferon, pyrimethamine, primaquine, and many chemotherapy agents used for Kaposis' sarcoma and lymphoma are common causes of neutropenia
171;;For example, in 1966 almost 2 million pounds of shells were harvested from the Wabash and White Rivers in eastern Illinois for this purpose, and shellers in Pearl, Illinois were still shipping shell to Japan in 1987.
1710;;Infections can cause neutropenia directly by infecting the bone marrow or indirectly through the release of chemicals that block production of cells.
1711;;Examples of conditions that infect the bone marrow include tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).
1712;;HIV infection itself may also cause neutropenia.
1713;;Tumors such as lymphoma that grow in the bone marrow are another potential cause of neutropenia.
1714;;Neutrophils die continuously from age or from fighting infections, and your bone marrow must make new neutrophils to replace them.
1715;;Common causes of reduced neutrophil production are medications, infections, and tumors.
1716;;Drugs that often result in neutropenia in HIV-infected persons include trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim, Septra), ganciclovir (DHPG), zidovudine (AZT), interferon-alpha, pyrimethamine, primaquine, and many agents used for the chemotherapy of Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma.

172;;Pearl oysters are grown using hanging culture techniques, where oysters seeded with pearl forming nuclei are hung in baskets from lines supported by buoys, and utilize natural ocean productivity as food.
1720;;In ALL, the lymphocytes are not able to fight infection very well.
1721;;Also, as the number of lymphocytes increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.
1722;;Less-than-normal T-cell levels may indicate: * Congenital T-cell deficiency (rare) * Congenital immunodeficiency disorders * Acquired immunodeficiency disorders * Leukemias * Cancer * Hodgkin's * Acute viral infection * Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia * AIDS * Side effect of radiation therapy * Effect of aging
1723;;Less-than-normal T-cell levels may indicate: * Congenital T-cell deficiency (rare) * Congenital immunodeficiency disorders * Acquired immunodeficiency disorders * Leukemias * Cancer * Hodgkin's * Acute viral infection * Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia * AIDS * Side effect of radiation therapy * Effect of aging
1724;;Although the body attempts to produce new lymphocytes in order to replace the ones that have been destroyed, the number of CD4 cells in the blood gradually declines as HIV disease progresses.
1725;;In general, the CD4 count goes down as HIV disease progresses.
1726;;A person infected with HIV often has a lowered WBC count since the infection may suppress production of white cells from the bone marrow
1727;;A person with HIV infection usually has a normal neutrophil count but some medications given to fight the HIV infection or opportunistic infections such a cytomegalovirus (CMV), may cause a drop in the neutrophil count.
1728;;There are a variety of side effects associated with Hydroxyurea.
1729;;It can cause skin and nail changes, anemia, sores in the mouth, lowering of the white blood cell counts and platelets.There may also be some long term effects on a child's growth and fertility.
173;;Cultured Pearl shall mean the composite product created when a nucleus (usually a sphere of calcareous mollusk shell) planted by humans inside the shell or in the mantle of a mollusk is coated with nacre by the mollusk.
1730;;Hydroxyurea may also affect a developing fetus and it should not be taken by someone who is planning a pregnancy
1731;;CD4 cells are a major target for HIV. HIV binds to the surface of CD4 cells, enters them, and either reproduces immediately, killing them in the process, or remains in a resting state, reproducing when the cell becomes active.
1732;;Although the body attempts to produce new lymphocytes in order to replace the ones that have been destroyed, the number of CD4 cells in the blood gradually declines as HIV disease progresses.
1733;;The CD4 cell count is a marker of the level of your immune function at any given time, while the viral load is a measurement of the level of circulating virus in your blood.
1734;;As the virus reproduces, it destroys CD4 cells and reduces your count.
1735;;In general, the higher your viral load, the more quickly your CD4 cells will be destroyed.
1736;;Cancer chemotherapy can dramatically lower the CD4 count.
1737;;In general, the CD4 count goes down as HIV disease progresses.
1738;;Pearson's Syndrome Patients with Pearsons Syndrome may have poor food absorption (malabsorption) and low white blood cell counts (neutropenia).
1739;;Low red cell counts (anemia) can be a major problem, and low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) can also occur.
174;;Cultured Pearls A cultured pearl is also grown by nature but with the assistance of man.
1740;;Symptoms are often present in infancy.
1741;;Liver and kidney disease usually develop.
1742;;Examination of the bone marrow under the microscope reveals characteristic holes ("vacuoles") in many cells.
1743;;The disease is caused by a loss, or deletion, of large pieces of DNA from tiny structures in the substance of cells, which are called mitochondria.
1744;;Mitochondria are responsible for producing much of the energy that cells need in order to function normally.
1745;;What is the pattern of bone marrow failure? a.
1746;;The bone marrow fails to produce a specific type of white blood cell called "neutrophils."
1747;;When these cells are present in lower than normal numbers in the bloodstream, the condition is called "neutropenia." b. Low red cell count (anemia) c. Low platelet count (platelets are the cells which help the blood to clot) d. Patients may develop aplastic anemia when all 3 types of cells (red cells, white cells and platelets) are abnormally low because the bone marrow is not producing them.
1748;;Vinblastine can cause toxicity to the bone marrow, leading to low white cell counts (neutropenia) and increased risk of infection.
1749;;Common AIDS drugs that cause low white cell counts include AZT (Retrovir), ganciclovir (Cytovene) and alfa-containing drugs (e.g., Septra, Bactrim).
175;;This patented process involves the insertion of a "nucleus" into the oyster.
1750;;Cuomo announced that the first $668,000 in loans will go to four predominantly African-American churches: Second New Light Church in Bridgeport, CT ($413,000); Greater Mount Zion Tabernacle in Portsmouth, VA ($180,000); Emmanuel Church in Decatur, AL ($65,000); and the New Birth Temple Church in Shreveport, LA ($10,000).
1751;;We went to the Salem Baptist Church in a small town called Fruitland, an African American church that had been burned in November 1995, and met with congregants, pastors and community leaders from around that area.

2686;;When more confirmed passengers than expected actually show up for a flight, it is "oversold," and the air carrier must seek out passengers who are willing to give up their seats for compensation before bumping anyone involuntarily.
2687;;Overbooking is not illegal, and most airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain extent in order to compensate for "no-shows."
2688;;Passengers are sometimes left behind or "bumped" as a result.

2690;;Airlines set guidelines for what to offer passengers - money, a free trip, food, or lodging.
2691;;Federal rules protect you if you have been bumped against your will on most domestic flights or outbound international flights.
2692;;The airline must give you a statement describing your rights.If the airline is not able to get you to your final destination within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time, you are entitled to an on-the-spot payment as compensation.The amount depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay.
2693;;An airline may offer you free transportation on a future flight in place of a check for denied boarding compensation, but you have the right to insist on a check.
2694;;To be eligible for compensation, you must have a confirmed reservation.
2695;;An "OK" in the Status box of your ticket qualifies you in this regard even if the airline can't find your reservation in the computer, as long as you didn't cancel your reservation or miss a reconfirmation deadline.
2696;;Our rules require airlines to seek out people who are willing to give up their seats for some compensation before bumping anyone in- voluntarily.
2697;;This means carriers may negotiate with their passengers for a mutually acceptable amount of money-or maybe a free trip or other benefits.
2698;;DOT requires each airline to give all passengers who are bumped involuntarily a written statement describing their rights and explaining how the carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and who doesn't.
2699;;Those travelers who don't get to fly are frequently entitled to an on-the-spot payment of denied boarding compensation.

270;;So long as the immunities provided by the Security Council's May 22, 2003 resolution (and by the earlier sanctions regime) remain in effect, Iraq will be shielded from action by claimants and creditors.A framework to resolve outstanding debts and claims will need to be in place when those immunities are removed by the end of 2007, to prevent disruption to Iraq's international trade and financial relations.
2700;;The amount depends on the price of their ticket and the length of the delay:
2701;;* If you are bumped involuntarily and the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to get you to your final destination (including later connections) within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time, there is no compensation.
2702;;* If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time (between one and four hours on international flights), the airline must pay you an amount equal to your one-way fare to your final destination, with a $200 maximum.
2703;;If the substitute transportation is scheduled to get you to your destination more than two hours later (four hours internationally), or if the airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements for you, the compensation doubles (200% of your fare, $400 maximum).
2704;;You always get to keep your original ticket and use it on another flight.
2705;;If you choose to make your own arrangements, you can request an "involuntary refund" for the ticket for the flight you were bumped from.
2706;;The denied boarding compensation is essentially a payment for your inconvenience.
2707;;To be eligible for compensation, you must have a confirmed reservation.
2708;;An "OK" in the Status box of your ticket qualifies you in this regard even if the airline can't find your reservation in the computer, as long as you didn't cancel your reservation or miss a reconfirmation deadline.
2709;;You must meet the airline's deadline for buying your ticket.
271;;It is unclear if Iraq will be able to service its current debts.
2710;;Discount tickets must usually be purchased within a certain number of days after the reservation was made.
2711;;Other tickets normally have to be picked up no later than 30 minutes before the flight.
2712;;If the airline must substitute a smaller plane for the one it originally planned to use, the carrier isn't required to pay people who are bumped as a result.
2713;;The rules do not apply to charter flights, or to scheduled flights operated with planes that hold 60 or fewer passengers.
2714;;They don't apply to international flights inbound to the United States, although some airlines on these routes may follow them voluntarily.
2715;;Also, if you are flying between two foreign cities-from Paris to Rome, for example-these rules will not apply.
2716;;The European Community has a rule on bumpings that occur in an EC country; ask the airline for details, or contact DOT.
2717;;This action would eliminate a consumer notice about airline overbooking of flights that is required to appear on signs at airports, city ticket offices, and travel agencies.
2718;;However, that information would be available to consumers because it must accompany every ticket.
2719;;Federal regulations require airlines offering flights with a passenger capacity of 60 or more persons to establish boarding priorities for situations where an insufficient number of volunteers offer to take another flight.
272;;It seems likely, however, that Iraq's debt could be rescheduled for payment over a longer period of time.
2720;;In addition, airlines are required to give all involuntarily bumped passengers a written statement describing their rights, including the terms, conditions and limitations on compensation.
2721;;With certain exceptions, travelers who are turned away from a flight are entitled to denied boarding compensation, which amounts to being paid for the inconvenience of having to take another flight.
2722;;If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination within one hour after your original arrival time, there is no entitlement to compensation.
2723;;If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time, the airline must pay you an amount equal to the price of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $200.
2724;;On international flights, the delay in arrival time can be between one and four hours.
2725;;If the airline fails to provide substitute transportation or if the substitute transportation provided is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination more than two hours later (four hours later internationally) than your original arrival time, the denied boarding compensation doubles.
2726;;Hence, the airline will be compelled to pay you twice the amount of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $400.
2727;;If you have been involuntarily bumped, you can still keep your original ticket and use it on another flight.
2728;;If you choose to make your own arrangements, a request can be made for an involuntary refund to recoup the price of the ticket for the flight you were bumped from.
2729;;In cases where an airline has to substitute a smaller plane for the originally scheduled plane, the airline is not required to compensate passengers who are bumped as a result.Denied boarding compensation may also be withheld in certain cases where it is shown that a passenger has not complied with conditions imposed by the airline.
273;;At the Paris Club, debtors must be in a state of imminent default before they can avail themselves of these bodies.
2730;;To be eligible for compensation, passengers must have a confirmed reservation.
2731;;If your flight remains overbooked, you may voluntarily give up your seat and negotiate with the airline representative to get a later flight and compensation such as another free flight later, or upgrades to first class.
2732;;If you are involuntarily "bumped" from your flight and you had a confirmed reservation, meet the airline's ticketing and check-in deadlines, and your replacement flight arrives more than an hour after your scheduled flight, you could be eligible for monetary compensation, free flights, and more
2733;;would require a carrier to "inform a ticketed passenger, upon request, whether the flight on which the passenger has a ticket is overbooked"
2734;;When a flight is overbooked at the time of sale, the carrier should be required to inform the prospective passenger prior to completing the ticketing transaction.
2735;;Adopt an overbooking information rule that requires each airline to inform a ticketed passenger upon request if the ticketed flight is overbooked, as provided in Subparagraph
2736;;Add an overbooking information rule that affirmatively requires each airline to inform a prospective customer, without a specific request, if they are being sold a ticket on an already overbooked flight
2737;;The DOT requires airlines to compensate people who have been bumped against their will as a result of overbooking.
2738;;The DOT also requires airlines to give all involuntarily bumped passengers a written statement.
2739;;This will explain your passenger rights.
274;;They must also have in place a loan or economic policy program approved by the IMF.
2740;;This written statement will also explain how the airline chooses who gets bumped and who doesn't.
2741;;Frequent flyers are entitled to immediate payment of denied boarding compensation.
2742;;If you are not a frequent flyer there are many requirements for compensation.
2743;;Compensation depends on the price of the tickets and the length of the delay.
2744;;There is no compensation if you are scheduled to reach your destination within one hour of the original time by way of an alternate flight.
2745;;If the alternate flight will arrive between one and two hours of the original time, you will be paid the amount equal to one-fare; the maximum is $200.
2746;;If the delay will be more than two hours, your compensation may double to a maximum of $400.
2747;;You should always keep your original ticket for use at a later date.
2748;;Also, to the extent that such airlines have a limited ability to accommodate overbooked passengers, they must be especially cautious in applying their overbooking procedures.
2749;;If you volunteered to be bumped, your action may not interfere with performance of your official duties and may not cause any added cost to the Government.
275;;The IMF will likely need many months before it can reach a satisfactory agreement with Iraq.
2750;;However, if you are bumped involuntarily, the situation is quite different.
2751;;You may accept the benefits BUT with significant limitations since you are on official travel as an involuntary "bumpee."
2752;;You may claim expenses for that period on your travel voucher.
2753;;You may choose to accept the meals and lodging offered by the airline.
2754;;If you do, then you must reduce your claim for official travel expenses accordingly on your voucher.
2755;;The free meals and lodging from the airline are compensation to the Government, not to you.
2756;;Lastly, you can not use the frequent flyer credits for personal trips.
2757;;Because you remain on official travel status when you are bumped involuntarily, those frequent flyer credits belong to the Government.
2758;;The Government traveler who has been denied confirmed reserved space must ensure that the TSP shows "Treasurer of the United States" as the payee on the compensation check (and any ticket refund check).
2759;;Government travelers must give the TSP a receipt for the check(s), retain a copy of the receipt, and forward the check(s), the copy of the receipt, and any unused ticket to the agency for deposit or reuse.
276;;Iraq will need a recognized regime.
2760;;Voluntarily Surrendering Seat W hen travelers voluntarily surrender their seat; at the request of scheduled airlines, they may only be compensated when: (a) (b) Surrendering their seat does not interfere their performing official duties; W hen voluntarily surrendering their seat results in additional expense from personal funds and the traveler is not reimbursed; or As a result of volunteering the traveler is delayed during duty hours and is charged leave for the additional hours.

2805;;The California electricity crisis in 2000-2001 has proven the need for these three elements.
2806;;The major factors contributing to the electricity crisis in California were insufficient infrastructure, dysfunctional market rules, and inadequate market oversight and enforcement.
2807;;These and other factors caused wholesale prices for spot power during the crisis to be unjust and unreasonable.

2810;;From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Belden is alleged to have conspired with others to manipulate the California energy markets and to defraud California electricity customers and other participants in the wholesale electricity markets.
2811;;The Information alleges that in 1999, Enron's West Power generated approximately $50 million in revenues.
2812;;By 2001, West Power's revenues increased to approximately $800 million as the price of electricity skyrocketed.
2813;;Prices during the height of the energy crisis rose from $25 per megawatt hour to, in some cases, $1,500 per megawatt hour.
2814;;It is alleged that the price increase is attributable in part to the schemes charged in the Information.
2815;;Timothy Belden who headed Enron's Western trading desk pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud based on allegations that, from 1998 to 2001, he and others at Enron engaged in trading strategies

2817;;The Nevada Public Utilities Commission has been investigating allegations that Enron was gaming the daily capacity auctions at the Palo Verde delivery point.
2818;;And although Enron only had limited firm transmission rights over COB, Path 15 and ZP26, trading insiders allege that Enron was able to manipulate capacity enough to leverage its wholesale energy trading activities.
2819;;Second, engaging in transfer pricing allowed these various Enron divisions to overstate revenue and contribute to the accounting gimmickry that inflated the company's share price.
282;;We had useful discussions about how to proceed with the Iraqi debt -- recognizing that the Iraqi people cannot bear the burden of current debt levels -- and we recognize the need of the Paris Club to begin to address this issue.
2820;;These prices were far above what other power marketers were charging at the time, and far above what Enron had been charging prior to May 2000 (when the crisis began).
2821;;It is important to note that at the same time that White's Enron Energy Services division was manipulating the California energy market by charging inflated prices, Enron paid the D.C. lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie more than half a million dollars in the first 7 months of 2001 to lobby the "Executive Office of the President" on the "California electric crisis" according to the lobbying disclosure report filed with Congress on April 10, 2001.
2822;;The charges allege that Mr. Forney was the architect of several of the illegal trading strategies employed by Enron in order to manipulate California's energy markets.
2823;;"While California consumers were suffering through blackouts and Stage III alerts, Enron was manipulating western energy markets for profit through illegal, fraudulent means.
2824;;Mr. Forney, age 41 of Upper Arlington, Ohio, was first charged by criminal complaint on June 3, 2003.
2825;;He was later indicted on one count of conspiracy.
2826;;This latest indictment, which supersedes all other charges in the case, expands the charges faced by the defendant by adding 10 substantive counts of wire fraud based on transfers of money to and from Enron as a result of its illegal trading.
2827;;The indictment specifically alleges that Enron and Mr. Forney were involved in seven separate trading schemes to manipulate the California energy market during the height of the crisis.
2828;;The trading schemes were known within Enron as: Get Shorty, Death Star, Ricochet, the sale of non-firm energy as firm energy, non-firm export,, Off-Line Hubs and Load Shift.
2829;;The Death Star scheme, in which Enron is alleged to have submitted false schedules to make it appear that the company was relieving congestion on the energy lines, was also known as the Forney Loop and Forney Perpetual Loop.
283;;Their discussions "should also include beginning to review the issue of Iraqi debt," Snow said.
2830;;According to public documents in the case, Mr. Forney is alleged to have been the creator of Death Star.
2831;;According to the indictment, it was part of the conspiracy that Mr. Forney and others at Enron misrepresented the nature and amount of electricity Enron proposed to supply and the load it intended to serve, received payments for relieving congestion on transmission lines without actually relieving any congestion, misrepresented the nature and origin of energy, and promised to provide energy to California consumers that Enron either didn't have or did not intend to provide.
2832;;In January 2002, in response to allegations that Enron may have used its market position to distort electric and natural gas markets in the West, FERC initiated a fact-finding investigation into whether any entity, including any affiliate or subsidiary of Enron Corp., had manipulated electric energy or natural gas prices in the West since January 1, 2000.
2833;;More details about what FERC may have found had it been more vigilant were revealed last month, when Timothy Belden -- who headed Enron's Western trading desk -- pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, based on allegations that he and others at Enron engaged in trading strategies designed to manipulate energy prices in the California market from 1998 to 2001.
2834;;in response to allegations that Enron may have used its market position to distort electric and natural gas markets in the West, the Commission initiated a fact-finding investigation into whether any entity, including any affiliate or subsidiary of Enron Corp., had manipulated electric energy or natural gas prices in the West since January 1, 2000.
2835;;The information further charges that Belden and his co- conspirators exploited California's pricing rules to falsely represent electricity generated within California as more expensive than out-of- state energy.
2836;;These schemes charged also include misrepresenting the nature and amount of the energy that Enron proposed to supply.
2837;;And while Enron benefited from the overall rise in electricity prices, the information charges that a portion of these increased revenues was due to the execution of the schemes charged in the information.

2844;;In that conversation, the CA ISO employee requests that the Enron trader place a bid to buy excess standby power at a specific price, reveals bidding information only available to the CA ISO, and attempts to artificially raise the price for excess standby power in the hour-ahead market.
2845;;February 19, 2003 Federal regulators asked Californias grid operator for more information on energy companies that may have engaged in questionable electricity trading tactics to avoid the states price caps in mid-to-late 2000
2846;;November 13, 2002 A federal grand jury investigating the California energy crisis appears to be focusing on whether major electricity suppliers in the state worked together to rig prices in violation of the antitrust laws.
2847;;October 17, 2002 The head of Enrons energy trading operation in the West, Timothy Belden, agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge for his role in manipulating electricity prices in California.
2848;;September 18, 2002 The California Public Utility Commission alleges that five power generators deliberately withhold output during the states energy crisis in order to drive up prices.
2849;;August 13, 2002 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission launched a formal investigation into instances of possible misconduct by five companies alleged to have manipulated short-term electric and natural gas prices in the West.
285;;It urged early involvement of the Paris Club on the issue of Iraqi debt.
2850;;May 8, 2002 Electricity industry analysts warned yesterday that the memos showing how Enron Corp. manipulated Californias power supply in the past two years demonstrate that smart, very detailed market rules have to be devised and enforced.
2851;;May 7, 2002 Internal Enron documents outline trading strategies to manipulate prices in Californias power market.
2852;;The settlement resolves allegations that EPE aided Enron in specific transactions designed to reap inflated wholesale prices for Enron.
2853;;These transactions included "ricochet" deals in which Enron evaded price caps on energy sold within California.
2854;;In such transactions, Enron transferred energy across the California border, where it was held by EPE, then sold back into the state at uncapped prices.
2855;;Most significantly, FERC charged four energy companies - Enron Power Marketing, Enron Energy Services, Reliant Energy Services and BP Energy Company - of engaging in market manipulation that could now result in loss of their authority to charge free-market rates.
2856;;Second, we found pages and pages of transcripts that show energy traders were deliberately attempting to manipulate the Western market - frequently through strategies earlier Enron memos termed "Death Star," "Get Shorty," "Fat Boy," and "Ricochet," among others.
2857;;Additionally, Reliant had "camouflage transactions" where the company sold power out of California day-ahead to Arizona and New Mexico utilities, and bought it back for sale (at a much higher price) in California.
2858;;This was known in the Enron memos as the "Ricochet" strategy.

2866;;The information charges that Belden and others conspired to defraud California electricity customers through a variety of schemes designed to artificially increase payments from the California power manager to Enron.
2867;;As charged in the Information, Belden and his co-conspirators took advantage of California's system by submitting false schedules, bid and other information that made it appear that certain parts of the energy grid were congested - when in fact they were not - and then took payment for relieving that congestion.
2868;;The Information further charges that Belden and his co-conspirators exploited California's pricing rules to falsely represent electricity generated within California as more expensive out-of-state energy.
2869;;The schemes charged also include misrepresenting the nature and amount of energy that Enron proposed to supply.
287;;The amount of debt will first need to be determined before talks of debt restructuring or forgiveness can take place

2874;;Recently produced internal memoranda show that Enron may have systematically gamed the energy trading system, using techniques that added to electricity costs and congestion on transmission lines.
2875;;The documents also describe falsified power-delivery schedules, the submission of false information to the state, and the effective increasing of costs to all market participants by knowingly increasing the congestion costs
2876;;Coined "Death Star" and "Get Shorty," the internal Enron memos describe plans for elaborate schemes to deliberately manipulate California's energy market and force consumers to pay exorbitant energy prices.
2877;;Commission Staff's Final Report In an order issued on February 13, 2002, the Commission directed its staff to investigate whether Enron Corporation, or any other entity participating in the wholesale energy markets in the West, had manipulated prices for electricity or natural gas, or otherwise exercised undue influence over wholesale electricity prices, since January 1, 2000.Pursuant to this order, the Commission Staff conducted an extensive investigation using data requests, depositions, and other fact-finding tools.
2878;;On March 26, 2003, the Commission Staff released its Final Report.
2879;;In the Final Report, the Commission Staff found evidence of significant market manipulation in Western energy markets during 2000 and 2001.

2880;;Did California experience severe electric market problems? Clearly, yes.
2881;;Were these problems the result of market manipulation? We are currently investigating that issue.
2882;;Many observers agree that these problems stemmed in part from the poor design of the California electricity market and the lack of adequate reserves and demand response relative to growing electricity demand.
2883;;Those conditions made it possible for Enron (apparently) and possibly other market participants to exploit, profit from, and possibly exacerbate the magnitude of -2California's problems.
2884;;It has been alleged that Enron, through its affiliates, used its market position to distort electric and natural gas markets in the West.
2885;;This on-going staff investigation is gathering information to determine whether any entity, including Enron Corporation, through any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, manipulated short-term prices for electric energy or natural gas markets in the West, or otherwise exercised undue influence over wholesale prices in the West since January 1, 2000.
2886;;Strategies that involved "inc-ing load" -- artificially increasing load on schedules, dispatching generation in excess of actual load, and getting paid for the excess generation at the market clearing price; Strategies that exploited the congestion management system by relieving real or artificial congestion; Strategies that exploited the California v. Western price differential (e.g., megawatt laundering); and, Strategies that involve misrepresentation (paper trading of ancillary services when the company doesn't actually have the services to sell, submitting false information about the identity of the plants providing the services, and selling nonfirm energy as firm to the PX)
2887;;For example, one of the strategies called "Get Shorty, " and characterized as "paper trading, " requires that "false information" be submitted to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).
2888;;Enron's "Ricochet" strategy, known more commonly as megawatt laundering, is another example of potentially illegal conduct.
2889;;"Enron buys energy from the PX in the Day Of market, and schedules it for export.
289;;G7 leaders agreed informally at the June 2003 summit to suspend through 2004 the requirement for Iraq to service any existing debt, giving time to construct some sort of multilateral debt restructuring arrangement
2890;;The energy is sent out of California to another party, which charges a small fee per MW, and then Enron bought it back to sell the energy to the ISO real-time market."
2891;;The memoranda describe the "Load Shift" trading strategy in which Enron creates the appearance of artificial congestion by deliberately overstating its loads.
2892;;Enron then reverts back to its true load and is paid congestion charges from the CAISO.
2893;;The memoranda state: "One concern here is that by knowingly increasing the congestion costs, Enron is effectively increasing the costs to all market participants in the real time market."
2894;;This amounts to an admission that Enron knows that it is affecting the price in the congestion market and that it deliberately overstated its load in order to drive up the congestion price.
2895;;Investigators said they suspected Enron was using price information obtained in regulated deals to manipulate trades in unregulated energy derivative markets.
2896;;The FERC found Enron and other companies lied about the prices of their trades, reported fictitious trades to drive up prices, did wash trades with each other, and engaged in rapid trading to drive prices up and then back down, reaping millions of dollars of profits in the process and costing customers billions of dollars in unjustified energy costs.
2897;;The information was made public as part of FERC's investigation into California's accusations that energy marketers manipulated the wholesale electricity market during the state's energy crisis.
2898;;The memos described strategies such as "Death Star" and "Get Shorty" that were designed to increase profits in the California energy market.
2899;;In August of 2002, that investigation produced an interim report describing the manipulative trading practices that Enron's traders had allegedly engaged in.
29;;Production leveled out in the early 1980's, due in part to increases in exploration in the late 1970's and in part to increases in the number of new developmental wells and older stripper wells producing on existing oil fields.
290;;Broad agreement among creditors is necessary before a country's foreign debts can be forgiven or rescheduled.
2900;;Those findings have further prompted three formal FERC investigations into the behavior of individual companies, including Enron, in the crisis.
2901;;Internal Enron documents released today show that traders for the company drove up electricity prices during the power crisis through questionable practices that may have contributed to power shortages
2902;;Attorney General Bill Lockyer today announced a $15.5 million settlement with El Paso Electric Company (EPE) that resolves allegations EPE colluded with Enron during California's energy crisis to manipulate the wholesale market and artificially inflate prices.
2903;;Enron's ability to deal in complex unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas market while controlling a tremendous share of the gas trading market, provided Enron the ability to manipulate market prices.
2904;;This was very likely a key factor in driving up gas and electricity prices leading to the California energy crisis."
2905;;CBS news reported in May that former Enron traders admitted that the energy company was directly responsible for rolling blackouts in California.
2906;;The CBS article mentions that Enron traders played a disturbing role in blackouts that hit California.
2907;;The report mentioned specific manipulative behavior by Enron on June 14 and 15 in the summer of 2000 when traders said they intentionally clogged Path 26.
2908;;That is a key transmission path connecting northern and southern California.
2909;;Here is what one trader said about that event:

2912;;On January 17, 2001, California Governor Gray Davis declared a state of emergency due to the energy crisis and electricity is clearly an "essential good."
2913;;The memoranda acknowledge that the strategies Enron employed resulted in lower energy supplies in California and caused higher energy prices.
2914;;The memoranda further admit that the strategies may have contributed to Stage 2 emergencies
2915;;On December 6, CAISO declared a Stage 2 emergency, a public declaration that electric reserves had fallen below five percent.
2916;;Enron claims its manipulation of the market may have caused this shortage, though that was never investigated by CAISO.

3054;;Aside from cabotage laws, which exclude foreign carriers from domestic service, economic regulation of domestic shipping was largely limited to movements of nonbulk commodities- commodities which, for domestic water transport, are significant only for movements to or horn domestic These noncontiguous locations (Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, etc.). movements were originally subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), but FMC'S regulatory authority was sharply curtailed in 1978 when carriers were allowed to "file annual increases of 5 percent or less with 60 days notice without being subject to suspension
3055;;International water transport is generally free of the route restrictions that affect air traffic.
3056;;Accordingly, ports and routes served are determined by market forces rather than by international agreements.

3313;;The talks with bullies often include their parents and reinforce the message that bullying will not be allowed.

3315;;Following the model bullying prevention program developed by Olweus, the entire school will participate in violence prevention activities to reduce bullying among the school's sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders.

360;;Epidemiologic studies have found that aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is associated with decreased risk of developing or dying from esophageal cancer (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.47-0.71).
3600;;Community groups, school and individual artists contribute their artistic talent to create murals for Metro bus shelters.
3601;;Requesting a brochure is all it takes to start.
3602;;The six upper panels of the mural are based on housepost figures.

3646;;Peace looks on serenely as a partially robed man whose face is said to resemble President Ulysses S. Grant puts down a one-man Roman rebellion.
3647;;The third large mural shows Justice seated at her throne.
3648;;She is holding a scale in one hand and a sword in the other.
3649;;To her left stands Columbia who holds a shield decorated in stars and stripes.
365;;In a randomized study of 635 patients with prior colorectal cancer (T1 to T2 N0 M0) who had undergone curative resection, aspirin intake at 325 mg/day was associated with a decrease in the adjusted relative risk of any recurrent adenoma as compared with the placebo group (0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91) after a median duration of treatment of 31 months.
3650;;Columbia is standing ready to defend Justice's decisions.
3651;;To the right of Justice stands a woman who is rejoicing because the decision was in her favor.
3652;;Another figure is grieving because the decision was against her.
3653;;A medium sized mural, depicts a reclining, partially nude Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.
3654;;There are six small oval murals, each contains a cherubic looking child called a "genius" (a tutelary deity or guardian spirit).
3655;;Each genius is engaged in an agricultural task.
3656;;The six ovals were originally located around the Ceres mural.
3657;;Completed in May 1938 Lochrie's mural, News from the States, showed a varied group gathered by a communal "post office" in Frying Pan Basin northwest of Dillon, which Lochrie had visited with Dillon postmaster Harry Andrus when creating her design.
3658;;Situated on the stage route between Butte and Dillon, this locale provided a logical setting for a mailbox that symbolized the importance the mail to early residents and stressed how the postal service facilitated the sharing of ideas and goods.

366;;As reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Benjamin Chun-Yu Wong, from the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues analyzed data from nine studies that looked at the link between NSAID use and stomach cancer.
3660;;The second mural commission went to Verona Burkhard, whose James and Granville Stuart Prospecting in Deer Lodge Valley-1858 (1939, oil on canvas, 56 1/2" x 144") prominently featured local history and landscape features, including Mount Powell in the Flint Creek Range west of Deet Lodge.
3661;;The mural showed an outline of Section officials invited Henry Meloy, a Montana native and Columbia University art professor, to design the Hamilton mural.
3662;;His Flathead War Party shows the tribe preparing to attack the Blackfeet with Mount Como, a Bitterroot Valley landmark, in the background.

3665;;Meloy's finished mural, Flathead War Party, shows the tribe preparing to attack the Blackfeet, with Mount Como, a Bitterroot Valley landmark, in the background.
3666;;An accomplished artist, Meloy knew to focus on historical topics and local scenery
3667;;The last post office mural installed in Montana was Leo Beaulaurier's Trailing Cattle.
3668;;Impressed by the sketch Beaulaurier submitted for the Glasgow competition, Rowan invited him to create a mural for the Billings post office in October 1941.
3669;;Beaulaurier's mural featured longhorns in the foreground, with the browns and whites of the animals contrasting with the blended blues of the river and sky.
367;;Collectively, the studies included 2831 patients with stomach cancer.
3670;;The second mural commission went to Verona Burkhard, whose James and Granville Stuart Prospecting in Deer Lodge Valley-1858 (1939, oil on canvas, 56 1/2" x 144") prominently featured local history and landscape features, including Mount Powell in the Flint Creek Range west of Deet Lodge.

3672;;Flathead War Party is pictured in color on the back cover (1942, oil on canvas, 77 1/2" x 168").
3673;;Since that time, over 700 murals have been installed in Metro bus shelters.
3674;;Murals have been created by volunteers of all ages: students, scout troops, senior citizens, community groups and individual artists.
3675;;Luverne: "Cotton Field," Arthur Getz, 1942.
3676;;Getz received the commission for Luverne on the basis of designs he had submitted for a competition for the War Department building.
3677;;As a northern artist he was warned by the Section when he proposed the theme of cotton: "It will be necessary for you to acquaint yourself thoroughly with the appearance of a cotton plant as the individuals using this post office will be especially observant on this point."
3678;;Getz consulted southern painters as well as researching the growing of cotton while he worked on the mural.
3679;;The story of the completion of Getz's mural was all too familiar late in the Section program.
368;;Overall, NSAID use was tied to a 22-percent reduction in the risk of stomach cancer.
3680;;He had received the commission for the Luverne mural in May of 1941.
3681;;In February of 1942, while completing the project, he needed a letter for his draft board from the Section to allow him to finish the work.
3682;;Getz seems to have managed to complete the mural and send it to Luverne for installation only a week or ten days before he was to be inducted into military service.
3683;;Tuscumbia: "Chief Tuscumbia Greets the Dickson Family," Jack McMillan, 1939.
3684;;McMillan, a New York artist, chose the theme of his mural after visiting Tuscumbia shortly after receiving the commission.
3685;;The Section had proposed that he consider using Helen Keller, but the residents of Tuscumbia suggested the arrival of Michael Dickson and his family.
3686;;McMillan actually produced sketches using both themes and the Section office chose the Dickson panel as "unusually handsome in its simplicity and plastic qualities."
3687;;The mural seems to have been very well received by the residents of Tuscumbia.
3688;;A long newspaper article appeared after the mural was installed elucidating the story of the Dickson family who arrived by river in Tuscumbia after fleeing the Johnson massacre in Tennessee.
3689;;Chief Tuscumbia greeted them and sold them a large tract of land for $5.00 and two pole axes.
369;;The risk reduction seen with aspirin use was nearly identical to that of other NSAIDs, the researchers note.
3690;;Brewton: "Logging," John von Wicht, 1939 (missing).
3691;;The Brewton mural is the one mural which today is missing.
3692;;Originally from Germany, but in 1939 a resident of New York City, von Wicht chose as his theme the early history of the lumber industry in the area around Brewton.
3693;;When it was installed it was met with many favorable comments by the postmaster and the citizens in Brewton.
3694;;Carrollton: "Farm Scene with Senator Bankhead," Stuart R. Purser, 1943.
3695;;Several local groups from Carrollton and the postmaster had written to Washington to request that their town be given a mural and that it honor and depict U. S. senator John H. Bankhead, Jr., who had helped them secure the federal building/post office it was to decorate.
3696;;The mural was awarded to Stuart Purser of Louisiana, who complied with the thematic choice of the citizens of Carrollton.
3697;;The final panel shows Bankhead talking with a farmer in front of a typical Alabama farm using the newer methods of terracing and field rotation introduced by the Bankhead farm programs.
3698;;When the mural was completed the head of the Carrollton Civic Club wrote to the Section: "We are very proud of the mural and it looks so well in place.
3699;;I think Mr. Purser caught the idea we had in mind and has put in the picture not only the atmosphere of our county but conveys as well the thought that Mr. Bankhead was particularly interested in that part of life."
37;;Where experience had once been sufficient for an oil job, formal education was now required .
370;;The benefits of NSAIDs seemed to be based on the frequency of use.
3700;;Eutaw: "The Countryside," Robert Gwathmey, 1941.
3701;;The panel by Gwathmey was the Alabama winner of the 1939 48 States Competition.
3702;;Although Gwathmey had entered the competition with a panel designed for the post office in Phoebus, Virginia, he was invited to rework his design for the Alabama site.
3703;;Gwathmey wrote to the postmaster and the local newspaper editor for ideas.
3704;;When he got no reply from them he visited the site and discussed a possible theme with the local county agricultural agent.
3705;;He settled on a local lumber industry scene: the method of stacking pine boards for drying.
3706;;Although today considered a very nice work, this was one of the few Alabama works which did not receive an enthusiastic initial review.
3707;;When the postmaster at Eutaw wrote to the Section to verify the panel's final installation he included a short note: "We have but one newspaper and I asked the editor to give the mural a write up in the next issue, and was told that he had nothing to say."
3708;;Fairfield: "Spirit of Steel," *Frank Hartley Anderson, 1938.
3709;;Anderson, an Alabama artist, produced probably the most direct illustration of a local industry.
371;;For example, compared with non-use, regular NSAID use dropped the cancer risk by 43 percent, whereas irregular use reduced the risk by just 24 percent.
3710;;The scene and its relationship to Fairfield were described by Anderson in a letter to the Section: "Fairfield itself is entirely devoted to steel and iron, this covering of course the mining of coal and iron and the quarrying of limestone and dolomite, bringing them together and making iron, then steel, and into the finished bars, plates, structural steel, wire and nails.
3711;;The central motif, in the center, rear, is the converter 'up,' which Fairfield knows to mean 'all's right with the world.'
3712;;The flaming torch it makes as air is blown in lights up the sky for miles around.
3713;;. . .
3714;;At the right and left are the stacks of the steel mill, with cooling towers, and the furnaces making pig iron.
3715;;Below, at right and left, are the coal mines and the iron ore mines, both entirely underground.
3716;;In the center, right and left, are the scenes 'changing the furnace' and 'making bottom,' both important parts of the needed processes."
3717;;Anderson also wrote the Section office that 99% of the people using the post office were connected with the local steel industry and all seemed pleased with the mural.
3718;;Fort Payne: "Harvest at Fort Payne," Harwood Steiger, 1938.
3719;;Steiger, of New York, admitted he had never been as far south as Fort Payne when he received the invitation to produce a mural there.
372;;As reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Benjamin Chun-Yu Wong, from the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues analyzed data from nine studies that looked at the link between NSAID use and stomach cancer.
3720;;Steiger did make a trip to Fort Payne within a month and found the postmaster most helpful as he prepared his sketches.
3721;;The postmaster, in fact, told Steiger that he was pleased to be getting a mural although he had never heard of one before and he drove Steiger out into the country to see waterfalls.
3722;;Steiger proposed two different sketches for the mural: one showing the cotton industry in town and the other a landscape.
3723;;He and the Section both chose the "pretty landscape" as more pleasing.
3724;;Guntersville: "Indians Receiving Gifts from the Spanish," Charles Russell Hardman, 1947.
3725;;A very late addition to the program, little information about the Guntersville mural is known.
3726;;There are no files or documents in the National Archives relating to it.
3727;;Hardman was a Florida artist who had done some earlier work for the Section, including a mural in Miami Beach on a similar theme.
3728;;Haleyville: "Reforestation," Hollis Holbrooke, 1940.
3729;;After he made a trip to Haleyville, Holbrooke chose to paint a scene of recent conservation work in the area of the Black Warrior Forest.
373;;Collectively, the studies included 2831 patients with stomach cancer.
3730;;He consulted both the postmaster, who wanted a picture of wildlife feeding in a forest setting, and the local forest ranger,who thought the picture should mean more to the people of the area than simply a pretty picture.
3731;;Holbrooke seems to have agreed and chose to document the benefits of both reforestation programs and land terracing to combat soil erosion, which he compared to the older, less effective methods of erosion control.
3732;;Holbrooke also wrote a lengthy explanatory note for the local newspaper about the mural and benefits of reforestation.
3733;;The two figures in the panel represent a C.C.C. worker and the forest ranger, Mr. Thomas Wilson.
3734;;Hartselle: "Cotton Scene," Lee R. Warthen, 1941.
3735;;Warthen, of Washington, D.C., produced the Hartselle panel as the result of his entry into the War Department Building Competition.
3736;;Warthen did extensive research for the panel, wrote the local postmaster, and talked with U.S. House member John Sparkman, who was from Hartselle, about the local industry and activities used in the final panel.
3737;;Huntsville: "Tennessee Valley Authority," Xavier Gonzalez, 1937.
3738;;The Huntsville mural was the largest and most expensive panel commissioned in Alabama and the only one placed in a federal courthouse rather than a post office.
3739;;Gonzales received the invitation for the panel based on designs he had submitted for a competition in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1936.
374;;Overall, NSAID use was tied to a 22-percent reduction in the risk of stomach cancer.
3740;;He originally proposed a rather odd allegorical panel that the Washington office criticized for both its style and its lack of meaning for the people in Huntsville.
3741;;Instead of making allegorical allusions it was suggested that Gonzalez place emphasis on the realities of life.
3742;;Using a realistic style and basing his new theme on the work then being done by TVA in northern Alabama, he redesigned the panel several times.
3743;;It was ultimately put in place in October of 1937 and described by Gonzales: "Huntsville, Alabama is situated in the lower angle of the Tennessee River and has profited immensely by the benefits derived from the Muscle Shoals Project.
3744;;Before this undertaking was begun, the country, being unprotected, was at the mercy of floods and calamities.
3745;;The benefits of electricity were a privilege of the few who could afford the exorbitant price, the soil of the country was being washed away by the floods, and industry and agriculture were underdeveloped due to the uncertainty of land conditions.
3746;;Since the completion of this project tremendous benefits have been received . . . the control and proper use of water resources; . . . conservation and preservation of land resources; . . . [and] the disposition of surplus electric energy created as a by-product of the irrigation and flood control."
3747;;Luverne: "Cotton Field," Arthur Getz, 1942.
3748;;Getz received the commission for Luverne on the basis of designs he had submitted for a competition for the War Department building.
3749;;As a northern artist he was warned by the Section when he proposed the theme of cotton: "It will be necessary for you to acquaint yourself thoroughly with the appearance of a cotton plant as the individuals using this post office will be especially observant on this point."
375;;The risk reduction seen with aspirin use was nearly identical to that of other NSAIDs, the researchers note.
3750;;Getz consulted southern painters as well as researching the growing of cotton while he worked on the mural.
3751;;The story of the completion of Getz's mural was all too familiar late in the Section program.
3752;;He had received the commission for the Luverne mural in May of 1941.
3753;;In February of 1942, while completing the project, he needed a letter for his draft board from the Section to allow him to finish the work.
3754;;Getz seems to have managed to complete the mural and send it to Luverne for installation only a week or ten days before he was to be inducted into military service.
3755;;Monroeville: "Harvesting," *Arthur Leroy Bairnsfather, 1939.
3756;;A.L. Bairnsfather, of Birmingham, submitted three initial sketches to the Section after his invitation to do the Monroeville mural.
3757;;The Section chose a harvesting scene even though Bairnsfather suggested to them that there was actually very little grain grown in the area.
3758;;The mural was installed in January of 1939 and the postmaster and public were so pleased that they requested another panel for the opposite wall of the lobby.
3759;;Montevallo: "Early Settlers Weighing Cotton," William Sherrod McCall, 1939.
376;;The benefits of NSAIDs seemed to be based on the frequency of use.
3760;;McCall, at the time from Jacksonville, Florida, received the invitation to do the Montevallo mural in 1938 on the basis of designs he had submitted for a competition in Miami.
3761;;He immediately visited Montevallo and chose the theme of cotton and settlement of the region because,in his words, "Montevallo was a very important little town to the cotton industry of the State in the early days."
3762;;The postmaster, in the letter written to verify the installation of the mural, commented: "I would like to state that the citizens find the work a beautiful addition to our building and wish to thank the Federal government for this contribution.
3763;;The heads of the Departments in our Alabama State College, as well as those students who are able to comment upon Mr. McCall's workmanship, join me in saying that it is one of the best pieces of work seen in the State."
3764;;McCall wrote a final letter to the Section in which he commented upon his royal treatment in Montevallo.
3765;;Oneonta: "Local Agriculture--A.A.A. 1939," Aldis B. Browne, 1939.
3766;;Browne's Oneonta panel depicts a series of local scenes, all of them suggestions from the people of Oneonta.
3767;;Also noteworthy about the Oneonta mural was the working method used by Browne.
3768;;He came to Oneonta from Connecticut and painted the work directly on the wall to the delight of the local citizens, who apparently came by daily to inspect his progress.
3769;;Browne reported to the Section office that he was "nuts" about Oneonta, and that the greatest debate going on was whether the jug on the wall held corn whiskey, since Blount County was dry.
377;;For example, compared with non-use, regular NSAID use dropped the cancer risk by 43 percent, whereas irregular use reduced the risk by just 24 percent.
3770;;Included in the scheme, behind the central figures, are the specific local scenes and buildings requested by the postmaster and local citizens: to the left the city of Birmingham dam, which was located seven miles from the town, and on the right a local strip mine.
3771;;Across the top are local Oneonta buildings: the Baptist and Methodist churches, the post office, cotton warehouse, sawmill, courthouse and jail.
3772;;Finishing the background is a house and a covered bridge.
3773;;Browne was pleased to report to the Section that the central section, comparing a terraced field to one neglected and worn by erosion was already being used by the local agricultural office to show farmers the benefits of modern scientific methods of planting.
3774;;The letter written by the postmaster to verify the final installation of the panel was effusive in its praise for the Section, Browne, and the mural.
3775;;Opp: "Opp," Hans Mangelsdorf, 1940.
3776;;Opp received a very nice sculptural commission by Mangelsdorf, a New Orleans artist, who within a month of receiving the invitation visited Opp.
3777;;He sent not only sketches to the Section office but also his assurance that he had tried to include everything the people of Opp suggested as important for a representation of their town.
3778;;The final piece was described in a local newspaper after installation: "In the relief agriculture is personified by the woman holding a basket of corn in one hand and flowers in the other hand, and the church in the background indicates home, life, and education.

3782;;Ozark: "Early Industry in Dale County," *Kelly Fitzpatrick, 1938.
3783;;The Ozark panel was the first of two murals painted by Wetumpka artist John Kelly Fitzpatrick, with Phenix City the second.
3784;;Fitzpatrick was awarded the commission on the basis of work he had done under TRAP, an earlier Treasury program.
3785;;He actually proposed several different themes, including a scene from local history depicting a famous battle between Samuel Dale and local native Americans, a decorative and allegorical panel, and a postal history panel.
3786;;The Section however wanted him to try a local industry theme.
3787;;They suggested as a model the easel painting of a mill that he had previously produced under PWAP, and which was then hanging in the White House.
3788;;That sketch was ultimately approved and used.
3789;;When the mural was installed a notice in the local paper complimented it highly.
379;;Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Some studies have shown that the use of aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer.
3790;;Phenix City: "Cotton," *Kelly Fitzpatrick, 1939.
3791;;The Phenix City panel was the second of two murals by Fitzpatrick, a Wetumpka artist, with Ozark the first.
3792;;Its theme is the southern cotton crop.
3793;;Before it was installed in the Phenix City post office it was exhibited at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts and described in the local newspaper: "The subject of the mural is a cotton growth cycle showing the various steps from the planting of the seed to weaving it into cloth.
3794;;The scene is a typical east Alabama landscape where one gently rolling hill rises above another and on each succeeding level a period of growth is depicted."
3795;;The Phenix City mural is still in place although the building is now the public library.
3796;;Russellville: "Shipment of First Iron Produced in Russellville," Conrad A. Albrizzio, 1938.
3797;;The mural for Russellville turned out to be one of the most controversial in Alabama.
3798;;Albrizzio submitted two sketches of local industry shortly after he was invited to undertake the commission.
3799;;The Section office chose the scene of a local quarry over that of an early iron mine.
38;;Technology has transformed the industry multiple times .
380;;A daily baby aspirin reduced by 19 percent the risk that precancerous polyps (adenomas) in the colon would recur in patients who'd had a previous adenoma surgically removed, researchers reported April 7, 2002, at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in San Francisco.
3800;;The Section apparently made their decision in early July 1937 and by the end of the month they had received numerous telegrams in protest from Russellville clubs and business concerns.
3801;;The local population proposed a slightly different theme of the old Alabama Iron Works, the first iron furnace in Alabama, built in 1817.
3802;;Similar letters were also sent from Alabama to Senator John H. Bankhead, Jr., in Washington.
3803;;One of the letters described the general theme and the details the Russellville businessmen wished to have included: "We know the beehive shape of all charcoal furnaces erected at the date.
3804;;We know that the furnace and forge were motivated by water power through a race that still exists.
3805;;We know they used a five hundred pound hammer to shape the pig--we have the hammer.
3806;;We know the ore was collected by slave labor and hauled in ox carts to the furnace.
3807;;We know the pig iron, much of it, was hauled by ox wagon thirty-five miles to the Tennessee River and shipped to Liverpool, England, and we have the records where it was sold at one hundred dollars a ton.
3808;;The rock wall foundation of the warehouse still stands along the creek bank."
3809;;After a series of letters between Albrizzio, Bankhead, the citizens of Russellville, and the Section, Albrizzio redesigned to the wishes of the local population and eventually went to Russellville and painted the mural in fresco on the walls of the post office.
381;;The producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and California.
3810;;Scottsboro: "Alabama Agriculture," Constance Ortmayer, 1940.
3811;;Ortmayer was teaching at Rollins College in Florida when she received the invitation to do a panel in Scottsboro.
3812;;She chose a theme based on Alabama agriculture, especially cotton and corn.
3813;;She described the final images: "Three phases of cotton growing form the theme of the central panel.
3814;;On the right the cultivation of the crop is symbolized by the young man working with a hoe among the new plants.
3815;;Opposite a young woman is depicted picking ripened bolls, and for the background, the processing and shipping of cotton is represented by the bales and the strong figure of a second young worker standing between them.
3816;;Both of the flanking panels interpret the growing of corn.
3817;;The young man and woman shown on the right are examining the fruit on the ripened stalks and the couple on the left are represented as workers who have harvested the new crop."
3818;;The Section office wrote about the work in these words: "In a sculpture characterized by clean, flowing lines, Miss Ortmayer gives an exceptionally effective representation of the youthful strength and grace that each new generation brings to the agriculture of the south."
3819;;Tuscumbia: "Chief Tuscumbia Greets the Dickson Family," Jack McMillan, 1939.
382;;The producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and California.
3820;;McMillan, a New York artist, chose the theme of his mural after visiting Tuscumbia shortly after receiving the commission.
3821;;The Section had proposed that he consider using Helen Keller, but the residents of Tuscumbia suggested the arrival of Michael Dickson and his family.
3822;;McMillan actually produced sketches using both themes and the Section office chose the Dickson panel as "unusually handsome in its simplicity and plastic qualities."
3823;;The mural seems to have been very well received by the residents of Tuscumbia.
3824;;A long newspaper article appeared after the mural was installed elucidating the story of the Dickson family who arrived by river in Tuscumbia after fleeing the Johnson massacre in Tennessee.
3825;;Chief Tuscumbia greeted them and sold them a large tract of land for $5.00 and two pole axes.
3826;;Tuskegee: "The Road to Tuskegee," *Anne Goldthwaite, 1937.
3827;;In addition to depicting local scenes, Goldthwaite, a Montgomery artist, used the suggested Section theme of postal history for her Tuskegee panel, as she did with her other mural in Atmore.
3828;;In the finished mural the theme is international, but the symbols are peculiarly Brazilian.
3829;;The scene is a 16th-century coastal settlement, a village where such Jesuit fathers as Anchieta and Nï¿½brega labored in peaceful penetration to instruct the Tupi Indians and save their souls.
383;;The producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and California.
3830;;The painter has carefully grouped his figures to show the trust and affection of these Indians for their devoted preceptos.
3831;;Mural Characteristically, Portinari's first painting, Discovery of the Land, is dominated not by captains or the admirals or the priests of the conquest but by the common sailors who manned the fleet.
3832;;This mural has the most baroque composition of the series.
3833;;It is divided vertically by the twisting ropes of the ship's rigging and ladders.
3834;;The sweeping diagonals of the gunwales and the swirling masses of water join with the powerful exultant figures of the men to heighten the movement and excitement of the scene.
3835;;The wind of conquest and of expectation seems to blow through the picture and the effect is heightened by the Tiepolo-like blues and greys and whites, the true tonalities of the sea, that predominate.
3836;;Mural The second painting, Entry into the Forest, is reminiscent of frescoes in the Brazilian Ministry of Education.
3837;;The idea of representing tropical animals, birds, and insects in a jungle setting derives from the decorations of the dining room Portinari prepared for the Rio de Janeiro residence of Senhor Josï¿½ Nabuco.
3838;;On the wall, however, the picture assumed larger proportions.
3839;;This mural contrasts with the first in that the composition is more static and the figures more solidly realized.
384;;The producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and California.
3840;;Yet there is the same insistence upon essential things in the meticulous rendering of the hands and arms of the explorers and the almost unfinished aspect of the figure of the drinking man beside the stream.
3841;;Mural The two murals in the larger room present a similar stylistic contrast.
3842;;The Teaching of the Indians, built around a classic triangular arrangement of figures, follows the sober, contained tradition of Portinari's early work.
3843;;As with the Discovery mural, the artist originally planned a different composition.
3844;;In the finished mural the theme is international, but the symbols are peculiarly Brazilian.
3845;;The scene is a 16th-century coastal settlement, a village where such Jesuit fathers as Anchieta and Nï¿½brega labored in peaceful penetration to instruct the Tupi Indians and save their souls.
3846;;The painter has carefully grouped his figures to show the trust and affection of these Indians for their devoted preceptos.
3847;;In both paintings there is violent excitement; both represent the tenseness of the moment of discovery; both are exultant.
3848;;But here the painter introduces a more frenzied pattern through the symbol of the worker's hand, raised, gesticulating, grasping, pressing.
3849;;Impressionistic in color in the sudden brilliant strokes of unrelated colors on the skiff, in the hair of the miners, in the glint of gold and the tiny gleaming fish, this painting marks the farthest evolution of the painter's mural style toward the dissolution of form and color and derives from a series of experimental oils centering around the theme of a shipwreck, which Portinari made in the summer of 1941
385;;Slate was quarried from Peach Bottom as late as 1957 for granules in composition roofing shingles.

3861;;"Spirit Journey" The images for this mural are drawn from the cultures of the Puget Salish Tribes of the Pacific Northwest Coast.
3862;;These tribes are often overlooked in histories of the region and are seldom represented in public art collections.
3863;;The art of these indigenous groups, such as the Duwamish, Snoqualmie, Tulalip, and Muckleshoot, differs considerably from the art of their neighbors to the north.
3864;;The mural over the entrance to the Hearing Room depicts an incident in the reign of Caesar Augustus Octavius.
3865;;[Ceasar_Mural_-_Potter.jpg] The Roman writer Seutonious tells of Scutarious, a Roman legionnaire who was being tried for an offense before the judges seated in the background.
3866;;The legionnaire called on Caesar to represent him, saying: "I fought for you when you needed me, now I need you."
3867;;Caesar responded by agreeing to represent Scutarious.
3868;;Caesar is shown reclining on his litter borne by his servants.
3869;;Seutonious does not tell us the outcome of the trial but leaves us to surmise that with such a counselor he undoubtedly prevailed.
387;;Found in Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maine, Virginia, California, Colorado; Europe.
3870;;The mural on the left of the Hearing Room shows King John of England (1166-1216) sealing and granting Magna Charta (the Great Charter) in June 1215 on the banks of the Thames River at the meadow called Runnymeade.
3871;;His reluctance to grant the Charter is shown by his posture and sullen countenance.
3872;;But he had no choice.
3873;;The barons and churchmen led by Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, forced him to recognize principles that have developed into the liberties we enjoy today.
3874;;King John, out of avarice, greed or revenge, had in the past seized the lands of noblemen, destroyed their castles and imprisoned them without legal cause.
3875;;As a result, the noblemen united against the king.

3880;;Although he was in France at the time, Thomas Jefferson was painted into the mural because of his great influence on the principles of the Constitution.
3881;;The mural on the right wall shows the trial of Chief Oshkosh of the Menominees for the slaying of a member of another tribe who had killed a Menominee in a hunting accident.
3882;;It was shown that under Menominee custom, relatives of a slain member could kill his slayer.
3883;;"The Blizzard of 1888" mural represents the story of the worst blizzard ever recorded in the history of Nebraska.

3890;;The shimmering tiles of red, orange, yellow, gold and blue look like the corpse of rustling cottonwood trees (the state tree).
3891;;"The Building of the Railroad" mural shows the importance of progress and scientific advancement.
3892;;Because of Nebraska's location on the Great Plains and because of its time of settlement, railroads have been central in the state's history.
3893;;This mural also represents the importance of the train during the Wild West.
3894;;"Building the Capitol" mural is the last mural to be installed.
3895;;It shows the second state capitol of Nebraska, a quote from the Declaration of Independence and to the right an outline of the current capitol building.

3990;;Many, incidentally, have obtained citizenship, but after taking the test three or four times and not being able to master the English, you can imagine the frustration and really the demoralization that occurs with that.
3991;;This is necessary because learning English has been the greatest obstacle for the Hmong patriots, as written characters for the Hmong language have only been introduced recently, and whatever chances most Hmong who served may have had to learn a written language were greatly disrupted by time spent fighting alongside U.S. forces

3997;;One major setback for many, is that their command of the English language is insufficient to successfully complete the naturalization process.
3998;;This is partly because, up until the 1950's, the Hmong did not have a written language, which has made learning to speak, read, and write the English language extremely difficult.

4001;;Currently, the majority of these former soldiers and their refugee family members who are now in America cannot become U.S. citizens, because they lack sufficient English language skills to pass the naturalization test.
4002;;The major barriers to naturalizing for many of the Hmong and Laotian veterans are related to their high illiteracy rate and lack of formal education, which prevents them from learning the English needed to pass the citizenship exam.
4003;;In addition to issues of literacy and education, these veterans have reached an age where learning a new language is more difficult.
4004;;Many also came in with mental and physical disabilities acquired as a result of the war, making it extremely difficult for them to learn a new language.
4005;;For instance, the civics exam continues to pose an insurmountable barrier for some.

4050;;The earlier waves of refugees during the post-1975 period generally were better educated and wealthier than later arrivals, many of whom--especially Hmong (a Chinese-origin population that migrated to Laos and later to Thailand and the United States) and Laotians--were poor, illiterate, and not at all used to western culture at the time of their resettlement.
4051;;The trauma of dislocation and resettlement is related to many of the health problems of these Asian subpopulations.
4052;;About 615,000 Vietnamese, 149,000 Laotians, 147,000 Cambodians, and more than 90,000 Hmong resided in the United States in 1990 (23).
4053;;Hmong and Cambodian Americans reported poverty levels above 45 percent
4054;;The resettlement of more than 1million Indochinese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s made the bimodal distribution even more pronounced because refugees arriving after 1979 have experienced higher rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty than other Asian Americans, and other minorities (37).
4055;;For example, in 1980, unemployment among the Hmong (20 percent), Laotians (15 percent), and Cambodians (11 percent) all exceeded the U.S. average
4056;;Prenatal care is another form of preventive care that many Asian American women do not receive.
4057;;Nearly half of Cambodian and Laotian American women do not begin prenatal care during their first trimester and have higher risk births because of this (137,142).
4058;;Of the five major Indochinese groups in Oregon (Khmer, Hmong, Mien, other Lao, and Vietnamese), Hmong American women had the least favorable birth risk profile (142).
4059;;Mean birth weight among Hmong infants born in California between 1985 and 1988 was significantly lower than mean birth weight among white infants (143).
406;;Today slate continues to be quarried domestically as well as being imported from Europe, China and South America
4060;;The preterm and low-weight infants born to Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian mothers in 1992 are reflected in the aggregate rates of 12 percent (preterm) and 7 percent (low birth weight) for births to all women in the category "Remaining Asian or Pacific Islander Total."

407;;The Vendor Slate Co. had ten quarries in Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York in 1929.
4070;;These problems stem from the Natural Cultural Barriers that exist between Asian and Western societies, as well as the distinct issue of an underdeveloped and underutilized Hmong written language.
4071;;First, the Hmong population's roots are in an extremely underdeveloped portion of Asia, providing them with limited experience to a capitalist system.
4072;;This fact, coupled with their relatively recent migration to the United States as political refugees, suggests that the Hmong are likely to suffer from sub-optimal access to credit from commercial banks and other formal financial institutions.1 Second, the Hmong community located in 1 Evidence exists that immigrant groups in general lack capital and sufficient credit history to borrow from banks and financial institutions

4314;;The trematode parasite, Ribeiroia (linked to amphibian malformations elsewhere), was identified at 3 of 16 ponds examined for parasites in 2000 and 6 of 13 ponds examined in 2001.
4315;;Of the 260 amphibians necropsied for parasites only 11 were considered to be malformed and five of these eleven harbored Ribeiroia.
4316;;Ribeiroia was found in only northern leopard frogs and green frogs.
4317;;But there is no evidence that ultraviolet light can cause missing legs, Ankley concedes, especially at the only slightly elevated levels found in nature.
4318;;Parasites have long been suspected of causing limb deformities by infecting a tadpole and forming cysts in its developing legs.
4319;;This is advantageous to the parasite, the hypothesis goes, because leg deformities cripple frogs, making them more susceptible to predators--including the aquatic birds that are the primary hosts for Ribeiroia.

4350;;Although frogs with multiple hind legs generated a great deal of media attention, this was not the most common deformity being observed in the new outbreaks; missing legs, partial legs, and otherwise misshapen legs have been far more prevalent.
4351;;These deformities were first discovered by kids at the New Country School in Henderson, Minnesota.
4352;;They were looking for frogs in the river and found lots with deformed and missing legs.

4418;;Raising tadpoles in the lab, the researchers found that the tadpoles will chew each others' limbs off under crowded conditions, resulting in frogs with missing limbs just like those found in the wild.Thus the research points to two different kinds of deformities with two different causes: frogs with malformed limbs including extra limbs, caused by parasites, and frogs with missing limbs caused by attempted predation.
4419;;In Vermont, after examining over 7000 northern leopard frogs, only one frog had an extra limb.
442;;Every jockey who is engaged to ride in a race shall report to the scale room on the day of the race at the time required by the officials.
4420;;The first hint of trouble among frogs came in 1993, when a group of schoolchildren discovered frogs with malformed and missing limbs in a Minnesota farm pond, and posted their findings on the Internet.During the following two years, reports of deformities increased but were restricted to a few localities and one species, the northern leopard frog ( Rana pipiens ).
4421;;In the summer of 1995, middle school students on a field trip to a farm pond in southern Minnesota discovered large numbers of frogs with misshapen, extra, or missing limbs.
4422;;About 50% of the northern leopard frogs they caught that day were malformed.Since then, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of malformed amphibian in North America.

4426;;For example, the wildlife pathologist said, two frogs from Minnesota in 1998 were missing a single middle bone from each toe on both feet.
4427;;Frogs from the study site in Maine and two sites in Minnesota had bones duplicated in their hind limbs, primarily in the form of multiple toes.
4428;;In addition, the research revealed that although multiple -- or extra -- limbs were found in only 5 percent of the frogs in the study, all frogs with multiple limbs came from the two sites in Minnesota and the site in Maine where frogs were also afflicted with multiple toes.
4429;;In Vermont, for example, all of the 65 malformed frogs the researchers examined were missing all or a portion of their hind legs, but none had multiple toes or limbs.

4430;;Of the Vermont frogs missing entire limbs, x-rays revealed that 73 percent were also missing bones in the hip, providing evidence that a predator had not removed the limbs, but that developmental errors were to blame.
4431;;During a field trip in 1995, kids from a Minnesota middle school discovered unusual characteristics in some frogs.
4432;;In fact, quite a few frogs showed significant malformations: missing limbs, extra limbs, and missing eyes were all observed by the group.
4433;;The first hint of trouble among frogs came in 1993, when a group of schoolchildren discovered frogs with malformed and missing limbs in a Minnesota farm pond, and posted their findings on the Internet.
4434;;During the following two years, reports of deformities increased but were restricted to a few localities and one species, the northern leopard frog ( Rana pipiens ).
4435;;For example, the wildlife pathologist said, two frogs from Minnesota in 1998 were missing a single middle bone from each toe on both feet.
4436;;Frogs from the study site in Maine and two sites in Minnesota had bones duplicated in their hind limbs, primarily in the form of multiple toes.
4437;;In addition, the research revealed that although multiple -- or extra -- limbs were found in only 5 percent of the frogs in the study, all frogs with multiple limbs came from the two sites in Minnesota and the site in Maine where frogs were also afflicted with multiple toes.
4438;;In Vermont, for example, all of the 65 malformed frogs the researchers examined were missing all or a portion of their hind legs, but none had multiple toes or limbs.
4439;;Of the Vermont frogs missing entire limbs, x-rays revealed that 73 percent were also missing bones in the hip, providing evidence that a predator had not removed the limbs, but that developmental errors were to blame.

4440;;Frog Number AGI1-29 squirmed uncomfortably in Tom Faber's hand.
4441;;The inch-long leopard frog, a beautiful iridescent green with black polka dots, looked normal at first glance.
4442;;As Faber checked the frog's hind legs, however, it became clear that frog No. 29 had problems.
4443;;There were stumps where the toes of one foot should be.
4444;;More than 15 percent of the frogs Ferguson and Levey inspected at four locations had deformities, including missing feet, withered or missing hind legs, and missing or malformed eyes.
4445;;In one day, the pair collected more deformed frogs, 38, than had been reported to the state in 75 years.
4446;;In Minnesota, where researchers have more frog-collecting experience, they found a frog with an eye inside its throat and another with virtually no hind legs.
4447;;In a lab study, Harris found that 72 percent of the frogs that were invaded by cysts like those produced by the trematode developed abnormal legs, especially duplicate legs.
4448;;For northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), the species most commonly found in Minnesota, 6.5 percent of 13,763 frogs collected were malformed.
4449;;Malformations included missing limbs, missing digits, extra limbs, partial limbs, skin webbing, malformed jaws, and missing or extra eyes (Helgen and others, 1998; Canfield and others, 2000; Meteyer, Loeffler, and others, 2000).

4455;;frog missing entire limb
4456;;Categories of abnormalities were primarily missing and incomplete hind limbs and shortened and missing digits.
4457;;Of the Vermont frogs missing entire limbs, x-rays revealed that 73% were also missing bones in the hip, providing evidence that a predator had not removed the limbs, but that developmental errors were to blame.
4458;;Scientists have reported that northern leopard frog embryos develop abnormalities, including deformed and missing limbs, after being exposed to about 30% of natural UVB levels for at least 24 days.

4460;;Malformed hind limbs were present in 157 (86%) of these frogs, which underwent necropsy and radiographic evaluation at the National Wildlife Health Center.
4461;;These malformations are described in detail and classified into four major categories: (1) no limb (amelia); (2) multiple limbs or limb elements (polymelia, polydactyly, polyphalangy); (3) reduced limb segments or elements (phocomelia, ectromelia, ectrodactyly, and brachydac-tyly; and (4) distally complete but malformed limb (bone rotations, bridging, skin webbing, and micromelia).

4465;;When Raymond Greffe stepped out of his house in rural Quebec to mow his lawn in July, he expected to see what he always sees: Hundreds of tiny new leopard frogs hopping like mad to get out of his way.
4466;;Instead, they were "crawling like toads or just falling over in the grass."
4467;;He picked one up.
4468;;Part of its hind leg was missing.
4469;;He picked up another and another -- 30 in all and 24 of them had a stump instead of a hind leg, or no hind leg at all.

4470;;In the fall of 1996, abnormalities in northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont.
4471;;Incidences of abnormal leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR ) on October 9, 1996.
4472;;The incidence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed).
4473;;Several of the sites where deformities were observed were near the borders of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, Vermont.
4474;;Most of the abnormalities observed were missing legs or feet, but also included eye abnormalities.
4475;;Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two C anadia n prov inces.
4476;;Background and Justification: In the fall of 1996, deformities in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont.
4477;;Several sites were near the border of the Missisquoi NWR in Swanton, Vermont.

4480;;Most of the frogs observed had missing legs or feet and some had eye abnormalities.
4481;;Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two Canadian provinces.
4482;;Late metamorphosing frogs did not appear fit enough to migrate to their over-wintering site due to the small body size and lack of muscle in the limbs (field observation).
4483;;Along with this observation, more severe malformation types (extra legs, cranio-facial abnormalities, partial or missing hind limbs) appeared later in the season at this site (field observations).
4484;;More severe malformation types are displayed in the late metamorphosing leopard frogs such as abnormal jaws, ectromelia of hind limb and amelia.
4485;;Deformed Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens) with malformed limbs, including extra limbs, and missing limbs, were analyzed by Eric Paul, Fish and Wildlife Ecologist for the DEC, in collaboration with Dr. Stanley K. Sessions, a developmental biologist, and his students at Hartwick College.
4486;;The malformations found include missing or additional feet, legs, toes, and eyes, as well as musculoskeletal and urogenital defects.
4487;;Types of deformities Some frogs had missing eyes, but most problems were associated with strange limbs, especially back legs.
4488;;The deformities included extra, missing or partial legs, limbs that divided and branched, and unusual spikes or protrusions at the tail end of some frogs.
4489;;A Northern Leopard frog with an abnormal spine (see hump) and a missing right eye (anophthalmia), two of the significant malformations observed in frog populations.

6302;;Although I have written elsewhere that one might easily justify flattening the benefit structure in Social Security, especially in exchange for subsidies for saving, means testing is another matter.
6303;;Means testing of a substantial portion of the elderly population could be considered degrading, and means testing is highly inaccurate given the ability to shift assets to children or simply hide them.
6304;;Means testing also severely discourages saving for retirement
6305;;Nonetheless, direct general revenue financing of Social Security might reduce the willingness to deal with our long-term problems and could raise a whole series of other debates such as whether to means-test Social Security benefits.
6306;;Almost every American worker pays Social Security taxes and, upon retirement, receives a monthly benefit amount formulated on his or her lifetime earnings.
6307;;It would be entirely inappropriate to penalize retired workers by reducing their Social Security benefits because they have successfully provided for their retirement with savings, investments and private pensions.
6308;;Mr. Chairman, the Social Security earnings test is among the most unfair and counterproductive policies ever imposed by the Federal Government.
6309;;The earnings test was originally imposed for a reason that now makes no economic sense.
631;;If s/he is overweight, his/her mount may be disqualified and all purse moniesforfeited.
6310;;On April 21, 1980, the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Social Security held a hearing on the Social Security earnings test.
6311;;amendments also eliminated reimbursement of the cost of state vocational rehabilitation services from the trust funds except where it could be shown that the services had resulted in the disabled person leaving the rolls; postponed the lowering of the earnings test exempt age (from 72 to 70) until 1983
6312;;On April 21, 1980, the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Social Security held a hearing on the social security earnings test.
6313;;This application of denial is not applied to those persons who are the recipients of annuities or other retirement benefits from the private sector.
6314;;When Congress enacted GPO in 1983, it set a 'means test' precedent by introducing a means test provision into the Social Security program by denying the full application of spousal benefits to persons receiving government pensions.
6315;;This application of denial is not applied to those persons who are the recipients of annuities or other retirement benefits from the private sector.
6316;;We, as federal annuitants, share you and your colleagues' concerns over the impropriety of "means testing" in Social Security
6317;;According to the hypothesis, the RET was introduced into the Social Security Act of 1935 because the designers of the program were motivated, at least in significant part, by the industrial policy objective of removing older workers from the workforce in order to make room for unemployed younger workers.
6318;;It was born out of Depression-era reforms in 1935 to create jobs during the most grim economic period in U.S. history.
6319;;Millions of older Americans were discouraged from staying employed.
632;;(M) Contracts.
6320;;The earnings test reduced their overall income, making it unproductive for them to work beyond retirement age.
6321;;This meant younger workers with families could have jobs.
6322;;Under social insurance theory, the rationale for the RET is simple and straightforward: one must retire in order to receive a retirement benefit because loss of earnings due to retirement is the insured condition.
6323;;According to the hypothesis, the RET was introduced into the Social Security Act of 1935 because the designers of the program were motivated, at least in significant part, by the industrial policy objective of removing older workers from the workforce in order to make room for unemployed younger workers.
6324;;A further element of unfairness results from the fact that the earnings test applies only to wage income.
6325;;One can receive millions of dollars per year in interest, dividends and capital gains without losing a penny of Social Security benefits.
6326;;According to the Social Security Administration, 3.5 million people between the ages of 62 and 69 have some earned income, about 37 percent of all retirees under the age of 70.^(6) In 1995, 743,000 workers aged 65 to 70 had their Social Security benefits reduced because their earnings exceeded the allowed amount, 8.5 percent of all retired worker beneficiaries.
6327;;It should be noted that the earnings test also creates a kind of marriage penalty, because earnings by the primary Social Security recipient above the threshold can also reduce the benefits of auxiliary recipients.
6328;;Persons may receive SSI payments either as individuals or as couples.
6329;;Both members of a couple must be aged, blind, or disabled and must meet the financial means-test in order to collect payments.
633;;A jockey's weight shall include the jockey's clothing, saddle, girth, pad and saddle cloth.
6330;;The SSI means-test depends on income and resources.
6331;;There are complicated ways of counting various types of income and resources; but, in general, the maximum monthly income in 1994 for individuals applying for SSI was $454 and $672 for couples if they receive only Social Security and $953 for individuals and $1,389 for couples if their income is only from wages.
6332;;Countable resources are limited to $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples.
6333;;The bill also put the disability freeze into effect (see discussion on page 23), with disability determinations to be made by the appropriate State agencies, permitted a recipient to earn up to $1,200 a year without deductions, eliminated the earnings test for people age 72 and over, and dropped the 5 years of lowest earnings from average monthly wage determinations for benefit computation purposes.
6334;;H.R. 9366 as reported by the Finance Committee included the coverage of farm and domestic service workers, ministers, employees of state and local governments covered by a retirement system, and a small number of professionals.
6335;;It also increased the earnings test threshold to $1,200 a year, reduced to 72 the age at the earnings test no longer applied, and increased the lump-sum death benefit from $255 to $325.50
6336;;raised the earnings test limit to $1,680 a year instead of $1,500 (recipient lost $1 for every $2 earned between $1,680 and $2,880, and lost dollar-for-dollar for earnings above $2,880); added benefits for disabled widows and widowers at age 50, with a stricter definition of disability; liberalized the definition of blindness for disability payments; and clarified the definition of disability.
6337;;Before enactment of P.L. 96-473, two earnings tests applied to Social Security benefits.
6338;;One was an annual test, the other a monthly test.
6339;;If a recipient earned more than the annual limit, his benefits were reduced $1 for every $2 of excess earnings until all Social Security benefits were withheld.
634;;f the overweight is more than one-alf pound in excess of the weight the horse is to carry, the jockey shall declare the amount of the overweight to the clerk at least 45 minutes before the time appointed for the 1st race.
6340;;Under the monthly earnings test, however, if a person's earnings were less than one-twelfth of the annual amount, he or she could get full benefits for that month, regardless of annual earnings
6341;;Among these was a provision making SSA an independent agency, raising the Special Minimum benefit by $35 a month, increasing the earnings test limits for recipients over age 64, extending benefits to children adopted after the worker became entitled to benefits, regardless of whether the child was dependent on the worker before the worker's entitlement, again extending the existing provision for continued payment of benefits during appeal, and including deferred compensation in the determination of average wages for purposes of determining benefits and the maximum amount of earnings subject to the FICA tax.
6342;;In addition, workers are exempt from the test when they reach age 70.
6343;;For a worker below age 70, his or her earnings above the exempt amount affect not only his or her own benefits, but also the benefits of family members receiving benefits on the worker's earnings record.
6344;;In 1999, an estimated 1.2 million beneficiaries had some or all of their benefits withheld for some portion of the year under the earnings test due to work at age 62 or above.
6345;;One was an annual test, the other a monthly test.
6346;;benefits paid by the Social Security Administration which are ``Federal means-tested public benefits'' are supplemental security income payments made under title XVI of the Social Security Act.
6347;;The Social Security Administration announces that, of the programs it administers, only supplemental security income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act are ``Federal means-tested public benefits'' for purposes of title IV of the Personal Responsibility
6348;;Title I of the Act provided non-contributory, means-tested, old-age pensions, in the form of state welfare programs with federal funding.
6349;;Title II of the Act, what is now thought of as Social Security, provided old-age insurance through a contributory social insurance scheme.
635;;Each jockey shall be weighed out for the jockey's assigned horse not more than 30 minutes before the time fixed for the race.
6350;;The old-age insurance program required retirement from gainful employment as a condition of benefit receipt.
6351;;For wage earners, this requirement was and is measured primarily by a test of earnings levels, hence the RET.
6352;;The RET is simply the administrative form of the principle that one must be retired in order to collect retirement benefits from Social Security's old-age insurance program.
6353;;In order to become eligible for SSDI, an individual must first have enough Social Security covered work-quarters and secondly have a severe impairment which makes him or her unable to do his or her previous work or any other kind of substantial gainful activity which exists in the national economy.
6354;;There is no means-test.
6355;;Unlike SSDI, people receiving SSI because of blindness or disability have no work requirements, but must meet a financial means-test.
6356;;Persons under age 65 must meet both disability and financial criteria, whereas those aged 65 or over need only meet the financial means-test.
6357;;The privileges of access and transportation provided to personal assistance animals in section 40-9.1-2 shall be extended to family therapy pets which shall be further defined as primary companions which are to include but not be limited to dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs, that are working in the provision of pet assisted therapy treatment and education.
6358;;Companion dogs provide wheelchair patients with a source of social stimulation that is typically more constant and reliable than most human companions, including spouses, siblings, or therapists.
6359;;In addition, a number of empirical studies have demonstrated that the presence of a companion dog serves to increase the quantity and quality of attention directed toward the handicapped persons by both familiar individuals and strangers

6368;;It is hoped, that through the "friend" (dog) the offender will change his outlook on life and the way he does his time.
6369;;The program helps to create the opportunity for a human-animal bond to develop and grow as each offender develops a more caring attitude, and overall better self-image.
637;;A jockey's weight shall not include the number cloth, whip, head number, bridle, bit or reins, blinkers, flak jacket, helmet, safety vest, tongue strap, tongue tie, muzzle, hood, noseband, shadow roll, martingale, breast plate, bandages, boots and racing plates or shoes.
6370;;Throughout said interactions, the pet assisted therapy facilitator and the family therapy pet will abide by a set code of ethics and will follow professional guidelines to ensure that the actions and deeds of the pet assisted therapy facilitator reflect advocacy of profession, pets, and clients, and other professions; while simultaneously ensuring that the interaction of the family therapy pet and client remains beneficial and strives to enhance the quality of life through this animal-human bond.
6371;;Numerous studies now document the health benefits of the human-animal bond.
6372;;In addition to the traditional role of animals as helpers and guardians of disabled individuals, pets have helped millions of people who suffer from a variety of afflictions, from high blood pressure to AIDS.Senior citizens receive enormous comfort from the companionship of pets, and the health benefits are becoming more evident.
6373;;The staff at Wilford Hall Medical Center knew the cute b ut withdrawn 4-year-old girl had been sexually abused, but law enforcement authorities needed her to tell someone.
6374;;"I think she was too embarrassed to talk about it, so she kept quiet," Air For ce Maj. Margaret Kohut said.
6375;;"Then, I brought Max in.
6376;;He crawled up on her lap, a nd she told him."
6377;;Remarkable things happen sometimes when Max, a silky-coated brown dachshund, a nd other dogs and cats come prowling the halls and wards of this massive Air Forc e hospital at Lackland Air Force Base.
6378;;Like the time a comatose man responded to
6379;;the cold nose and warm fur of a visiting pet.
638;;No jockey shall weigh more than two pounds over the weight the jockey's horse is assigned to carry unless with consent of the owner or trainer and unless the jockey has declared the amount of over weight to the clerk of the scales not less than 15 minutes before the time of the race.
6380;;But mostly the animals bring smiles to the faces of bedridden patients, especially little boys and girls who have been isolated here by their rebellio us and broken bodies.
6381;;Like 3-year-old Alizabeth Watson, in for one of several operations she needs for a kidney problem.
6382;;A visit Nov. 19 by Max, Roscoe and a playful pug, Sammy, made her forget for a while the tubes taped to her arm.
6383;;"Bringing the pets here reduces patients' stress, lowers their blood pressure, " Kohut said.
6384;;"For awhile, they can forget about their problems and pressures."
6385;;The Animal Assisted Therapy Program has been on the books here since 1994, but nobody brought pets in until Kohut revitalized the program this summer.
6386;;Since July, six dogs, one cat and a rabbit have been coming weekly to cheer patients .
6387;;Next month, Kohut's husband will bring his cockatoo in.
6388;;Nobody yet has volunteered a pet snake.
6389;;Professional pet assisted therapy is based on the unique bond that exists between human beings and animals.
639;;To weigh in, each jockey shall carry to the scales all pieces of equipment with which the jockey weighed out.
6390;;There are numerous therapeutic applications these ties can
6391;;provide including improvement in one's self-image and sense of competence, nurturing a sense of
6392;;responsibility, expressing feelings and distress via the animal and developing one's curiosity and
6393;;motivation to learn, not to mention the endless hours of fun, warmth, learning, and love
6394;;The A.A.F. is dedicated to educating the public on such issues that impact on animal welfare, preservation, and protection, developing humane attitudes and compassion in young people, providing a pet therapy program to area nursing centers, and providing a continuing care program for dogs and cats.
6395;;The A.A.F. is dedicated to improving and protecting sentient life
6396;;The program reaches hundreds of people in 11 different local nursing homes each month.
6397;;Pets for Patient Progress allows people to feel once again the unconditional love animals give.
6398;;In our visits to nursing and convalescent centers, we discovered some residents needed a permanent home for their beloved pet when entering a nursing home became necessary.
6399;;In response to that need, we have established a Pet Retirement program that offers a lifetime of continuing care at the A.A.F.
64;;We were on our way to the moon!
640;;No jockey may be weighed in more than two pounds over the jockey's declared weight but consideration shall be given for excess weight caused by conditions at the race track, including mud and rain.
6400;;The plan offers two alternatives: One for immediate placement, and one for planning to cover the need for care when the owner no longer can provide that care.
6401;;Also, people may make a specific bequest in a will to care for a pet.
6402;;Volunteers and companion animals visit nursing homes to bring love and affection to our elderly and sick neighbors.
6403;;companion dogs for handicapped people confined to wheelchairs and "hippotherapy," horseback riding as part of a therapeutic program.
6404;;For patients with movement disorders, specially trained physical and occupational therapists use therapeutic riding in which the horse influences the patient rather than the patient controlling the horse.
6405;;The goal is to improve the patient's posture, balance, mobility, and function.
6406;;Mental stimulation the presence of animals serves to brighten the atmosphere, increasing laughter and play and decreasing people's feelings of isolation.
6407;;An occupational therapist is assisted by a dog and its handler in work to increase a person's range of motion in her shoulder.
6408;;A mental health professional incorporates a rabbit in working with a small group of adults with developmental disabilities.
6409;;People in the group are working on improving their communication and social skills.
641;;If the jockey is overweight, the jockey's mount may be disqualified and all purse monies forfeited.
6410;;Outward focus animals can bring individuals out of themselves and help them focus on their environment.Rapport animals can open a channel of emotionally safe, non-threatening communication between clients and therapists or staff.Acceptance animals have a way of accepting in a non-judgmental and forgiving way.
6411;;Socialization the presence of animals has been shown to encourage socialization between clients, between clients and staff, and between clients, staff and family or other visitors.
6412;;Mental stimulation the presence of animals serves to brighten the atmosphere, increasing laughter and play and decreasing people's feelings of isolation.
6413;;Physical contact or touch an animal to hold, hug and touch may provide safe, non-threatening and pleasant physical contact for residents who may find touch from another person unacceptable.
6414;;Physiological benefits holding an animal or watching aquarium fish may have a calming effect and dramatically reduce heart rate and blood pressure.
6415;;We lower heart rates and stress, and even can improve mobility and motivation in sick and injured people.
6416;;ACCS is in preliminary discussions with Tony Larussa's Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) in designing and developing an Animal Therapy Program to supplement ARF's Animal All-Star Program.
6417;;This program is designed to help abused children and teens by teaching them proper care and respect for animals, thereby leading to rehabilitation.
6418;;Therapeutic Program (in development) The Therapeutic Program will provide bereavement counseling for individuals who have lost a pet; temporary foster care for animals of victims of domestic violence, an emergency situation such as a fire, and for elderly who find themselves rushed to the hospital with no one to care for their pet(s); animal-assisted therapy and activities programs for senior and victims of abuse; and prevention and intervention of animal abuse programs.
6419;;General patient health benefits emanated from companion animals visiting these facilities include promoting activity; improving mobility skills, use of affected extremities, communication, and memory skills; helping patients forget about their pain, loneliness, or boredom; providing a warm body to touch, stroke, hug, and offer treats; filling the void felt by patients missing their animals at home; giving a sense of being needed and of being a care-giver again; putting long-lost smiles on faces; and, overall, restoring health and spirit to the lonely, shut-in, or ill.
642;;If a horse runs in muzzle, martingale, breastplate or clothing, it must be put on the scale and included in the jockey's weight.
6420;;Another direct health benefit includes the fact that many animals have a sixth sense about a person's mental or physical condition, and they alert facility staff members to potential problems.
6421;;pet companionship has demonstrated significant benefits for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease; pets lowered hyperactivity, verbal aggression, anxiety, and psychological suffering in these patients.
6422;;Pets have also demonstrated the ability to lower blood pressure in humans by their physical presence.
6423;;Some dogs have even been known to detect melanomas, a type of skin cancer,
6424;;Pet therapy is now utilized increasingly as physicians are recognizing the positive effects in treating human patients with the therapeutic use of animals.
6425;;A study of heart attack victims demonstrated that patients with pets in the family have a significantly greater chance of surviving.
6426;;Another study showed that people's blood pressure is lower when they are talking to pets than to other people.
6427;;Animals are also becoming an integral part of rehabilitation for children undergoing psychiatric treatment, or experiencing learning difficulties.
6428;;Pets can teach children responsibility, and social interaction at a young age.
6429;;Social/Therapy Dogs Social/Therapy dogs are trained for the main purpose of companionship.
643;;No whip or substitute for a whip, blinkers or number cloth shall be allowed on the scales nor shall any bridle, safety vest or safety helmet approved by the stewards be weighed.
6430;;There are also
6431;;visiting therapy dogs that help stimulate people in nursing homes or assisted living facilities to strengthen themselves physically by playing ball, brushing, petting, or going for a walk.
6432;;Any type of dog that is good natured can be used to provide these services.
6433;;Pets for Patient Progress This special program introduced in 1987 by the founders takes some of our dogs and cats to visit residents in area convalescent centers.
6434;;The benefits of these visits are numerous.
6435;;The visits are something residents can look forward to, because they know pets pay little attention to age or physical disability, but accept people as they are.
6436;;The physical interaction encourages use of a persons hands and arms, and stretching and turning their body.
6437;;Handling and petting the dog or cat has shown to reduce a persons blood pressure.
6438;;PET THERAPY Program Description Volunteers take companion dogs to visit residents of retirement homes.
6439;;Volunteers and their dogs interact with residents who range in health from independent and active to bedridden, most of them ex-pet owners.
644;;A safety vest shall weigh no more than two pounds and shall be designed to provide shock absorbing protection to the upper body, as evidenced by a label with at least a rating of five, by the British Equestrian Trade Association
6440;;Our primary goals for this program are to enhance the lives of our elderly Pet Therapy brings a smile or two to residents living in retirement homes.
6441;;clients, bring them a measure of happiness and fun through the love of our pets, and promote the positive reputation of Seattle Animal Shelter.
6442;;Summary Lady, a lovingly pampered cocker spaniel, and Tramp, a jaunty, freedom-loving mutt with a heart of gold, share an enthralling romance and thrilling adventures.
6443;;Initially, mill work was performed by daughters of local farmers.
6444;;In later years, immigration became the source of mill "hands."
6445;;It had helped drive the Yankee women out of the mills, and it was equally resented by workers a century later.
6446;;They wanted paid vacations, denied even to those who had been with the company for decades.
6447;;The latter's mills and boardinghouses soon fell victim to the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, along with the tenement neighborhood of Little Canada.
6448;;Mill employment all but disappeared, and nothing had yet taken its place.

6451;;The latter's mills and boardinghouses soon fell victim to the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, along with the tenement neighborhood of Little Canada.
6452;;Mill employment all but disappeared, and nothing had yet taken its place.
6453;;Strong competition began to erode Lowell's dominance of the textile market, and as profit levels began to decline, ideas of "corporate paternalism" began to fade.
6454;;Construction of the second mill at Waltham in 1816-1818 completed the evolution of the physical form, structural system, and construction technique that later would be used in Lowell.
6455;;Initially, these mills were built either as a series of similar structures, or constructed so they could easily be expanded.
6456;;Soon, drive pulleys and leather belting became standard in mills throughout the United States.
6457;;Francis continued experimenting with turbines, refining the design of an inward-flow turbine developed by an American named Samuel Howd in 1838.
6458;;Francis' experiments on turbines led to the mixed-flow reaction turbine, which became the American standard.
6459;;Management also turned to an innovative source of labor, the daughters of New England Yankee farmers.
646;;If a jockey intends to carry overweight exceeding by more than two pounds the weight which his horse is to carry, the owner or trainer consenting, he must declare the amount of overweight to the clerk of the scales at least 45 minutes before the time appointed for the race, and the clerk shall cause the overweight to be stated on the notice board immediately.
6460;;The success of the "Waltham Experiment" encouraged investors to explore other sites on which to expand and print calico cloth.
6461;;For most young women, Lowell's social and economic opportunities existed within the limits imposed by the powerful textile corporations.
6462;;Lowell factories, well connected to Boston by canal and railroad, provided an early model for subsequent U.S. corporate and entrepreneurial organization.
6463;;The Appleton Company moved production to the South, and operations at the Saco-Lowell Shop (formerly the Lowell Machine Shop) shifted north to Maine.
6464;;They asked for improved working conditions, which were hardly better than in the mid-19th century.
6465;;The remaining mill buildings seemed to be bleak reminders of an era of hard work and meager reward.
6466;;For many residents, remembering the past stirred up feelings of anger and abandonment.

647;;For failure on the part of a jockey to comply with this section, he may be punished.
6470;;For many residents, remembering the past stirred up feelings of anger and abandonment.
6471;;Conditions in the workrooms worsened until they resembled the conditions that the original shareholders wished to avoid.
6472;;In the 1920s and `30s the mills were considered no longer sufficiently profitable and were shut down, sold off
6473;;They wanted to establish companies that could provide a comfortable level of return over a long period of time with minimal risk to the individual investor.
6474;;The investors were able to make comfortable profits from their investments and the workers found new jobs and opportunities.
6475;;Lowell was praised by many as a clean, industrious marvel of its day.
6476;;Conditions in the workrooms worsened until they resembled the conditions that the original shareholders wished to avoid.
6477;;In the 1920s and `30s the mills were considered no longer sufficiently profitable and were shut down, sold off
6478;;The standard Waltham plan was rectangular, 150'-160' long (reflecting the dependability of interior overhead line shafting) by 40'-50' wide (the optimum for spaces relying on exterior windows for natural light).
6479;;The four stories of open floor space had a dormer-lit gable roof, brick construction with stone foundations, and a full-height exterior stair tower centered in one of the long elevations.
648;;Every jockey must immediately after pulling up ride his horse to the place of weighing, dismount only after obtaining permission from the official in charge and present himself to be weighed by the clerk of the scales; provided that if a jockey be prevented from riding to the place of weighing by reason of accident or illness by which he or his horse is disabled he may walk or be carried to the scales.
6480;;In the 1840s, he and Boston-based consulting engineer Uriah Boyden began experimenting with a new kind of waterwheel, called a turbine, that originated from the work of French engineers and Boyden.
6481;;Ten years later, the Suffolk Mills had installed several generators for this purpose.
6482;;Changes in technology and production capability influenced the development and appearance of the millyard over time.
6483;;Lowell offered the hope that the country would profit socially as well as economically by adopting industrialism as a way of life.
6484;;The early Lowell system was distinguished by its state-of-the-art technology, the engineers and inventors who worked on its canal system, its mill architecture, enormous production capabilities, rational city planning, and most of all, by its much-heralded workforce of Yankee "mill girls."
6485;;Thousands of immigrants from many other countries settled in Lowell in the decades after the Civil War, yet women remained a major part of the Lowell's textile workforce
6486;;Nevertheless, Lowell factories saw a number of strikes, including the first successful mass strike which was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (the "Wobblies") in 1912.
6487;;The workers could command better wages as other firms with military contracts-Remington, General Electric, and U.S. Rubber-competed with the mills for Lowell workers.
6488;;The Bigelow Carpet Company (formerly Lowell Manufacturing Company, one of the first textile firms in the city) departed in 1914, and Middlesex Mills ceased production in 1918.
6489;;Other companies took over their plants, but these closings were the first by firms that were part of Lowell's founding almost a century earlier.
649;;Except by special permission of the official in charge, every jockey must upon pulling up unsaddle his own horse, and no attendant shall touch the horse, except by his bridle.
6490;;Then in 1926 came a wave of closings.
6491;;The Hamilton Company went into receivership, followed by Suffolk, Tremont, and Massachusetts Mills.
6492;;The workers could command better wages as other firms with military contracts-Remington, General Electric, and U.S. Rubber-competed with the mills for Lowell workers.
6493;;It was clear that the textile industry would not lead Lowell back to prosperity.
6494;;The city's fortunes were at their lowest in the post-war years with the closing of the Boott and Merrimack mills in the 1950s.

65;;In the 1920s and 1930s, the oil industry spread out like a huge tidal wave over our great State of Texas, covering a large portion of our state and settling in many of the small towns, such as the town I started in, McCamey.
650;;Upon the returning of a jockey to the winner's circle to dismount after a race has been run, no one may touch the equipment of the jockey until he has been weighed in, except upon the approval of the official in charge.
6500;;It was clear that the textile industry would not lead Lowell back to prosperity.
6501;;The city's fortunes were at their lowest in the post-war years with the closing of the Boott and Merrimack mills in the 1950s.
6502;;They bought stock in early railroads to help them move raw materials and finished goods back and forth.
6503;;They established their own machine shop so they could invent and build newer and better machines.
6504;;They invested in banks and insurance companies to make sure they could get loans for even further expansion and growth and reduce the risk of losses from fire.
6505;;The use of belts and pulleys allowed for a smoother and more efficient transfer of power with fewer breakdown periods.
6506;;In 1821, they chose an area around the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River at East Chelmsford, Massachusetts.
6507;;This site became Lowell, the first large, planned, industrial city in America.
6508;;The system of factories and power canals created here surpassed previous engineering schemes in both scale and level of sophistication.
6509;;The term "mill girls" was occasionally used in antebellum newspapers and periodicals to describe the young Yankee women, generally 15 - 30 years old, who worked in the large cotton factories.
651;;If a jockey shall not present himself to weigh in or if he be more than one pound short of his weight or if he be guilty of any fraudulent practice with respect to weight or weighing or, except as provided in section 4228.1, if he dismount before reaching the scales or dismount without permission or if he touch (except accidentally) before weighing in any person or thing other than his own equipment, his horse may be disqualified and he himself may be punished as provided by this Subchapter.
6510;;Prior to the Civil War, textile manufacture was the most important American industry.
6511;;The first American power loom was constructed in 1813 by a group of Boston merchants headed by Francis Cabot Lowell.
6512;;Soon textile mills dotted the rivers of New England transforming the landscape, the economy, and the people.
6513;;The town of Lowell, Massachusetts was named after the inventor of the power loom, Francis Cabot Lowell.
6514;;Conditions in Lowell's mills were considered exemplary in 1800s.
6515;;As the few remaining large mills increased production in the late 1930s, workers responded to the escalating demands made on them.
6516;;The mills' "stretch-out"-the practice of increasing the workload for the same wage by assigning more machines to workers-recalled a similar demand made on female workers in the 1840s.
6517;;World War II quickened Lowell's economy.
6518;;The remaining textile mills in the city-Merrimack, Boott, Ames (the old Lawrence Company), and several others-increased employment dramatically, while the departure of men for military service brought more women into the labor force.
6519;;The boom proved only temporary for Lowell.
652;;If a horse carry more than two pounds over his proper or declared weight, his jockey shall be punished unless the judges are satisfied that such excess of weight has been caused by rain or mud.
6520;;When the war ended in 1945, orders for munitions and textiles fell off, and the city lapsed into its old economic doldrums.

6526;;When the war ended in 1945, orders for munitions and textiles fell off, and the city lapsed into its old economic doldrums.
6527;;As the mills of Lowell continued to grow and expand, these investors began to make other investments that they felt would keep their companies strong and successful.
6528;;Throughout the first few decades of Lowell's history, these factors combined to make its mill companies very successful.
6529;;Unfortunately, this "golden age" of prosperity was short-lived and competing mill cities were established as early as the 1830s using the successful "Lowell system" as a model.
653;;All jockeys taking part in a race must be weighed out by the Clerk of Scales no more than one hour preceding the time designated for the race.
6530;;By the end of the 19th century, most of Lowell's "mill girls" had been replaced by an army of immigrant families from across the globe.
6531;;That mill at Waltham, Massachusetts, was the first vertically integrated factory in the United States, which means that all operations for cloth production were accomplished under one roof.
6532;;As the century progressed, new technologies affected the millyard's development.
6533;;Structures were added.
6534;;The development of new means of fire protection such as ceiling sprinklers and better lineshafting to run machinery reduced the danger of fires spreading, allowing existing buildings to be connected.
6535;;As sources of artificial lighting were introduced, the original width of buildings was increased.
6536;;The introduction of steam power made it possible to construct several additional large buildings.
6537;;the turbines tested by Francis and Boyden reached an efficiency of 88%.
6538;;By 1910, Lowell's textile mills began to use hydroelectricity.
6539;;The Boott Cotton Mills complex contains mills built from the mid-1830s to the early 20th century, reflecting the early use of waterpower, steam power, and finally electric power.
654;;Any overweight in excess of one pound shall be declared by the jockey to the Clerk of Scales, who shall report such overweight and any change in jockeys to the Stewards for immediate public announcement.
6540;;In 1814 on the Charles River in Waltham, Massachusetts, a group of Boston investors introduced the first integrated cotton textile mill.
6541;;Here each step in the production of cloth from bale to bolt took place under one roof with machinery powered by water.
6542;;Lowell became America's model industrial city during the first half of the 19th century.
6543;;The Blackstone Canal, completed in 1828, facilitated the transport of agricultural goods, raw materials and finished products to all points between Worcester and Providence.
6544;;Since Uxbridge was halfway between the two, it became an overnight stopping place for canal boats.
6545;;Immigration grew, primarily of people from Ireland, to work the mills and make shoes and boots and by 1855, 560 people produced 2.5 million yards of cotton and woolen cloth in Uxbridge mills.
6546;;In the late 19th century, women held nearly two-thirds of all textile jobs in Lowell, with many immigrant women joining Yankee mill girls in the textile industry.
6547;;Kudzu and Chinese wisteria can overtop even mature forests, while Japanese honeysuckle can form dense cover below tree canopies.
6548;;Kudzu and Chinese wisteria can overtop even mature forests, while Japanese honeysuckle can form dense cover below tree canopies.
6549;;Kudzu and Japanese honeysuckle alone occupy over 7 million acres each and their spread rates are obviously increasing.
655;;A jockey's weight includes the riding costume, racing saddle and pad; but shall not include the jockey's safety helmet, whip, the horse's bridle or other regularly approved racing tack.
6550;;Kudzu, an aggressive invasive vine, was found in limited distribution in Oregon.
6551;;Today, kudzu is common in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, and west to Texas and Oklahoma (Edwards 1982).
6552;;The weed has also been reported in New York, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and Washington (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 1977).
6553;;It has also been observed at Biscayne and Everglades national parks in Florida.
6554;;Flaming.
6555;;A kerosene torch is played over the foliage, wilting the leaves and defoliating the plant.
6556;;Destroys above-ground growth.
6557;;Since kudzu vines usually will not burn during growth (because of their high water content), vines may be flamed (see above) two or three days prior to burning.
6558;;Several herbicides have been successfully used in the National Park Service to manage kudzu.
6559;;These projects are described in Bratton (1981), Rosen (1982), and Gangstad (1989).
656;;A jockey must be neat in appearance and must wear a conventional riding costume
6560;;Cut stump treatments have been effective at Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
6561;;These work best on small infestations or after foliar treatments the previous season.
6562;;Roundup and Rodeo, both Monsanto formulations of glyphosate, are still the safest herbicides for use in residential and environmentally sensitive areas.
6563;;In Missouri, kudzu has been found locally in Jackson, St. Louis, Howard, Christian, Wayne, Reynolds, Douglas, Newton, Lawrence, Ralls, and Taney counties.
6564;;Patches have also been sighted along the route of Old U. S. Highway 66 in Phelps Co. and along U. S. Highway 67 in Madison and St. Francois counties.
6565;;This vine grows up to one foot per day in early summer and can cover everything in its path.
6566;;In the South, it has become destructive to the point of pulling down power poles, breaking power lines, collapsing buildings and killing trees.
6567;;Grazing can be an economical alternative to mechanical or chemical treatments in some control situations.
6568;;It can be effective in combating younger infestations if used persistently during the growing season.
6569;;Kudzu is readily eaten by most livestock, but cattle grazing has shown the most success in eradication
657;;The trainer or owner may substitute a jockey when the engaged jockey reports an overweight in excess of two pounds
6570;;If the only feasible treatment is herbicides, then systemic chemicals provide the best success.
6571;;Old kudzu infestations may have overgrown an acre or more with older roots growing too deeply for manual removal.
6572;;A prescribed burn in March before herbicide treatment will kill the smallest plants and sever draping vines leaving roots and new growth a better chance for exposure to chemicals.
6573;;If preservation of a natural area limits the use of grazing or large-scale herbicide application, a combination of trimming, disking, and digging as outlined above will set the plants back and perhaps eradicate a new infestation in three to four years.

6760;;Franklin concluded that the introduction of large quantities of volcanic particles into the Earth's upper atmosphere could cause a reduction in surface temperature, because the particles would lessen the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface.
6761;;Volcanic eruptions are thought to be responsible for the global cooling that has been observed for a few years after a major eruption.
6762;;By reflecting solar radiation, such aerosols can lower the Earth's average surface temperature for extended periods of time by several degrees Fahrenheit.
6763;;Warmer than average winters and cooler than average summers over continental Northern Hemisphere areas have been documented and modeled after several eruptions, including Pinatubo, and this appears to be part of the normal Northern Hemisphere response after volcanic aerosol events
6764;;Specifically, they determined that there is a 20-percent probability for a Pinatubo-scale eruption (VEI = 6) and a 25-percent chance for an El Chichï¿½n-scale eruption (VEI = 5), both archetypes known to have temporarily cooled the Earth's surface air temperatures
6765;;When a volcano erupts it spews millions of tons of ash, debris, and gases into the atmosphere, not to mention the lava flows from some volcanoes.
6766;;Because of the presence of instruments - on the ground, at the ocean's surface, and in space - we observed a cloud of sulfur dioxide (SO[2]), emitted by Pinatubo, make its way westward, extending well past India within twelve days of the original eruption.
6767;;By three months, that cloud had completely encircled the Earth, as shown from space (below), and inside of a year SO[2] particles in the atmosphere were providing gloriously-colored sunsets all over the globe and lowering global temperatures, as well.
6768;;A model assessment is performed of average global air-temperature decrease because of stratospheric aerosols after the El Chichon eruption.</

6771;;The large aerosol cloud caused dramatic decreases in the amount of net radiation reaching the Earth's surface, producing a climate forcing that was two times stronger than the aerosols of El Chichï¿½n.
6772;;Effects on climate were an observed surface cooling in the Northern Hemisphere of up to 0.5 to 0.6ï¿½C, equivalent to a hemispheric-wide reduction in net radiation of 4 watts per square meter and a cooling of perhaps as large as -0.4ï¿½C over large parts of the Earth in 1992-93.

6776;;Apparently, even the largest eruptions have cooled the Earth only by about a degree or two Celsius.
6777;;Short term global cooling often has been linked with some major volcanic eruptions.
6778;;Sulfate aerosol formed in the stratosphere from sulfur dioxide in the Pinatubo cloud increased the reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space.

6780;;The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (H[2]SO[4]), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols.
6781;;The aerosols increase the reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere.

7290;;Total Knee Replacement Compared to THR, knee replacement surgery carries a higher overall risk of DVT, but lower risk of proximal DVT, with a prevalence of approximately 64% and 15%, respectively
7291;;This dispute apparently arose due [to] the history of treatment for the right knee injury, which according to Claimant's treating and referral doctors, has "cascaded" into a severe degenerative condition.
7292;;[Dr.

7317;;He explained that Claimant=s knee is so damaged that it is virtually bone rubbing against bone because the cartilage has been damaged and torn away.
7318;;He testified that more conservative care will do little to help Claimant under these circumstances because the only thing that can truly resolve the problem is a total knee replacement

7325;;He testified that standing on the metal grates and the cement floors increased the pressure on the joint surfaces.
7326;;This increased pressure led to arthritic changes in the knee joint which eventually resulted in a total knee replacement.
7327;;After the second 1995 fall, claimant underwent a second operation to repair the damaged tissues but remained unable to climb stairs or walk more than a block.
7328;;Because of those symptoms, Dr. Mohler, a specialist to whom Dr. Jones had referred claimant, deemed claimant to be a reasonable candidate for a total right knee replacement.

7385;;USAID support for ecotourism development and mangrove conservation on Isabela Island in the Galapagos is similarly oriented.
7386;;To raise national consciousness of the serious challenges of managing this global patrimony, build political will for sound management, and underscore that the more aggressive fishermen are not the Galapagos' only stakeholder group, the program implemented an effective program to better educate the country's mass media.
7387;;Support will continue to the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos for the conservation and preservation of the Islands' marine reserves and their native and endemic species.
7388;;Now that the Special Law for Galapagos has been passed, the Ministry of the Environment, in consultation with key groups from the Galapagos, is preparing guidelines for implementing the Special Law.
7389;;Also, it is expected that stakeholders will implement the Galapagos Marine Reserve Management Plan
739;;Any overweight in excess of one pound shall be declared by the jockey to the Clerk of Scales, who shall report such overweight and any change in jockeys to the Stewards for immediate public announcement.
7390;;Guardaparques comunitarios" are bolstering the weak park protection system with assistance from USAID partners and second-level organizations.
7391;;The Galapagos Marine Reserve has been designated as a protected biological area.
7392;;Relations between scientists at the research station and local fishermen in Galapagos have improved so that they are jointly discussing and trying to resolve issues related to marine reserve management and a new law for the Galapagos Islands has been presented to the Ecuadorian Congress for approval.
7393;;Support will be continued to the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos for the conservation and preservation of the islands' marine reserves and their exotic species.
7394;;This will also promote the issuance of a special law to protect the Galapagos ecology and biodiversity, which, when passed and implemented, will have positive impacts on both biological/ecological and urban components of the islands' ecosystems.
7395;;Special attention will be paid to conflict resolution/mediation among the parties interested in the use of the Galapagos' natural resources, including the local population and tourism operators.
7396;;Funding will support three important areas: 1) participatory fish stock management/data base development followed by participatory implementation and enforcement of fishing limits and regulation; 2) implementation of a community-based ecotourism plan on Isabela Island as an alternative income source to destructive overfishing; and 3) increased awareness and education about the fragility, complexity, and importance of longterm and sustainable resource management in the Galapagos.
7397;;The Galapagos Marine Reserve has been designated as a protected biological area.
7398;;In addition, USAID contributed to the establishment of a capital fund for the benefit of the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos Islands to guide the development of the sustainable, scientifically based, participatory management of the Galapagos ecosystem.
7399;;USAID is also assisting the Ministry of the Environment to establish policies, strategies and legislation for sustainable forestry development and biodiversity conservation in Ecuador
74;;Technology also made improvements in production.
740;;A jockey's weight includes the riding costume, racing saddle and pad; but shall not include the jockey's safety helmet, whip, the horse's bridle or other regularly approved racing tack.
7400;;Support will continue to the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos for the conservation and preservation of the Islands' marine reserves and their native and endemic species.
7401;;USAID's efforts focus, through technical assistance and training, on conserving Ecuador's rich biological resources by improving the country's environmental policy and legal framework; developing improved natural resource management practices; and strengthening the capabilities of local groups to carry-out effective conservation action.
7402;;Another high priority program area is conservation of the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR).
7403;;Planned activities in this UNESCO world heritage site include technical assistance and training to further enhance local governance, implement the GMR zoning plan, and increase tourism contributions to conservation by providing alternatives to illegal and over-fishing.
7404;;Support will continue to the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos for the conservation and preservation of the Islands' marine reserves and their native and endemic species.
7405;;The World Bank, through its Global Environmental Facility, is financing a biodiversity protection project which complements USAID-supported activities in the Galapagos, RECC and RECAY.
7406;;In addition, the IDB is financing a feasibility study which may lead to a loan of up to $15 million for environmental activities in the Galapagos.
7407;;Although USAID provides only a small proportion of total donor assistance in this sector, USAID environmental activities are on the cutting edge and lay the groundwork for other, major donors.
7408;;For example, the IDB is capitalizing on the solid waste management and quarantine studies previously supported by USAID in the Galapagos to expand this activity
7409;;USAID will use ESF funds to enhance the Galapagos National Park's capabilities to monitor and protect the Galapagos Marine Reserve through the purchase of specialized equipment.
741;;A jockey shall report to the clerk of scales for weighing out, not more than one hour and not less than 15 minutes before post time for each race in which he is engaged to ride, and at the time of weighing out shall declare overweight, if any.
7410;;Scientific assessments demonstrate that commercial tuna fishing in the Reserve can negatively affect the Galapagos' biological diversity through heavy bycatch on sea lion, shark, turtle, albatross, and other endangered species.
7411;;A general thanks is extended to all the people and institutions that collaborated wit h and made the revision and elaboration of the Management Plan for Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Galapagos Marine Reserve possible.
7412;;This was achieved through 74 meetings of the Central Group, 3 institutions and 2 Fishing Chambers containing the numerous participation of all of the user groups and involved institutions.
7413;;Other meetings of different sector groups and other island groups were also required.
7414;;All of this would not have been possible without the financial aid of the following institutions: USAID WWF GEF/INEFAN The Packard Foundation Charles Darwin Foundation of the Galapagos Islands Deutcher Entwicklungsdienst The Dennis Curry Charitable Trust
7415;;In Ecuador, USAID-supported policy dialog led to the 1997 enactment of the Galapagos Special Law.
7416;;After years of conflict among stakeholder groups, USAID sponsored a conflict resolution process in 1997 that facilitated development of a consensus among the three major groups with interest in the legislation: conservation, fisheries, and tourism.
7417;;The law enforces a quarantine system to protect the Galapagos' environment from species introduced from the continent.
7418;;It restricts immigration and empowers local institutions to take leadership in the affairs of the archipelago.
7419;;Another principal policy focus that has received USAID/Ecuador support has been the building of consensus to protect the Galï¿½pagos Islands and their surrounding ocean and translate that consensus into an effective law and its regulations.
742;;Following the completion of the race, a jockey shall ride his horse to the finish, salute the stewards before dismounting, designated area, salute the stewards, dismount, remove from the horse his equipment, without assistance, which is to be included in a jockey's weight, and move promptly directly to the scales where he may be weighed in by the clerk of scales.
7420;;A plant and animal, quarantine system for the Galï¿½pagos Islands has been designed and partially implemented.
7421;;These include activities to: develop sustainable uses for biological resources; promote environmental education and technology transfer, conservate biological resources in the Galï¿½pagos, develop the sustainable uses for Galï¿½pagos marine resources, and the development of sound environmental policies.
7422;;The development of improved policies, legal frameworks and science-based regulations has played a key role in reducing the often violent conflict associated with management of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
7423;;The biologically rich Reserve (the focus of USAID/Ecuador's efforts in the Galapagos) was declared a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in December 2001, a landmark victory for conservation and USAID.
7424;;USAID will support the Ecuador-Peru Peace Accords through improvement of the social and economic conditions of border area inhabitants.
7425;;The USAID program will continue to promote biodiversity conservation policies and models in one of the world's richest "megadiversity" nations.
7426;;USAID support will also help to stabilize some of the country's most vulnerable regions, including the Galapagos Islands.
7427;;The development of improved policies, legal frameworks and science-based regulations has played a key role in reducing the often violent conflict associated with management of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
7428;;The biologically rich Reserve (the focus of USAID/Ecuador's efforts in the Galapagos) was declared a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in December 2001, a landmark victory for conservation and USAID.
7429;;With its local partner, the Charles Darwin Foundation, USAID sponsored a policy dialogue among conservationists, tourism operators, commercial fishermen, and other stakeholders.
743;;Due to injury to either horse or jockey, the stewards may excuse the jockey from weighing in.
7430;;The result was the Galapagos Special Law, signed two years ago by Ecuadorean President Dr. Fabian Alarcon.
7431;;With its local partner, the Charles Darwin Foundation, USAID sponsored a policy dialogue among conservationists, tourism operators, commercial fishermen, and other stakeholders.
7432;;The result was the Galapagos Special Law, signed two years ago by Ecuadorean President Dr. Fabian Alarcon.
7433;;This landmark law declares the Galapagos a "national priority, restricts commercial fishing in nearby waters, " limits new migration to the islands, and establishes an inspection and quarantine system to keep non-native species out.
7434;;Biodiversity conserved in selected protected areas: Sustainable use and conservation of globally significant biological diversity, including in the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
7435;;With USAID/Ecuador's assistance more than 1.4 million hectares are now under improved management in areas ranging from Esmeraldas to the Condor Bioreserve.
7436;;USAID has implemented a number of programs involving site preservation for marine-protected areas.
7437;;For instance, it provided support for the implementation of a new Galapagos Special Law to establish a marine park and has begun funding a Bering Sea Marine Ecoregion Conservation program.
7438;;USAID anticipates continued support for biodiversity conservation in the Galapagos through FY 2006, based upon the emerging threats to this UNESCO Global Heritage Site.
7439;;This includes continued fish stock monitoring, marine reserve protection, and institutional strengthening of the GNP and local governments.
744;;A jockey's weight is measured against the jockey's assigned weight as published in the official race program.
7440;;Proximity and beneficiary taxes refer to a broad set of potential revenue streams that are paid by those who use or benefit from the facility.
7441;;These include: ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ Ticket Tax Food and Beverage Tax Lodging Tax Parking Tax Game day revenue from public parking ramps Car Rental Tax Media Access Charge Naming Rights
7442;;The Task Force believes that the value associated with naming rights of the facility should be considered as a potential source for public financing,

7445;;the fund of the authority which contains the state's portion of revenues received from the sale of the naming rights for the stadium
7446;;The Pohlads' consultants projected that the sale of naming rights and payments from concessionaires will generate only $35.0 million up front, which the Pohlads believe they would be entitled to receive
7447;;Teams do not, however, share stadium revenues (e.g., concessions, parking, luxury suites, club seats, naming rights, advertising), and local television and radio.
7448;;A modern stadium must create revenue streams from many sources (more seats close to the field, better luxury boxes, personal seat licenses, enhanced concessions, naming and advertising rights) to make the owner more competitive.
7449;;First, there are design revenues -- cash coming from the new design -- luxury suites, club seats, naming rights, advertising rights, concession rights.
745;;A jockey shall not weigh more than 1 pound less than the jockey's assigned weight published in the official program.
7450;;Qualcomm somebody has to pay them or Qualcomm loses out on the money they put in for the long- term naming rights?
7451;;Many teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights.
7452;;The authority shall negotiate the lease or sale of such naming rights to a public or private entity for a lease rate or sale price that represents the full fair market value of such rights.
7453;;The Timberwolves receive revenues from suites, advertising, and naming rights (Target Corp.).
7454;;In addition to stadium amenities, new facilities allow the opportunity for additional revenues through the sale of naming rights and Personal Seat Licenses
7455;;A corporate contribution of $70.0 million, of which approximately $60.0 million was generated through the sale of facility naming rights and the remaining $10.0 million from sponsorship revenue comprise the balance of the private funding.
7456;;Ford Motor Company purchased the naming rights for $60 million over 20 years
7457;;Many teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights.
7458;;Naming rights, personal seat licenses, and commemorative bricks.
7459;;As this report says, naming rights are a matter for negotiation.
746;;A jockey shall declare the amount of overweight at the time of weighing out.
7460;;Recently in the United States, naming rights for new professional sports stadiums typically have yielded $2 million to $2.5 million per year for terms of ten to thirty years.
7461;;The range is between $900,000 and $4 million per year.
7462;;The state and the team would agree on what shou ld be 10 considered as the revenue attributable to the naming rights, and thos e revenues 11 should be transmitted to the state
7463;;The proposal specifies that the Authority owns the naming rights to the publicly-owned stadium and shall negotiate a full fair market value price for the sale or lease of such rights.
7464;;The Pohlads projected that they would receive annual naming rights payments starting at $1.5 million in 2001 and increasing each year.
7465;;Pacific Bell has agreed to pay the Giants $2.1 million per year for 24 years for the naming rights to the new San Francisco stadium.
7466;;BankOne has agreed to pay $2.2 million per year for 30 years for the naming rights to the new stadium where the Arizona Diamond Backs will play
7467;;The proposal specifies that the Authority owns the naming rights to the publicly-owned stadium and shall negotiate a full fair market value price for the sale or lease of such rights.
7468;;First, the Tampa Sports Authority voted to give the new owner the right to renarne the existing Tampa Stadium.
7469;;Mr. Glazer has since sold the naming rights to the Houlihan's restaurant chain for $10 million.
747;;A jockey shall not ride in a race if more than 2 pounds overweight without the consent of the owner or trainer of the horse the jockey is to ride. b.
7470;;The bill would divide the revenue generated from the sale of the Mariner's stadium naming rights proportionately among the state, county, and the Mariners, based on the percentage of their contribution toward the construction of the baseball stadium.
7471;;This would force the Mariners to contribute some of their own money to build the stadium if they were to get any benefit from the sale of the stadium's naming rights
7472;;The private contribution included $50 million from corporate investments for naming rights, along with the remainder of stadium debt.
7473;;Recommends financing project through private business contributions, State of Minnesota General Obligation (GO) bonds, pre-paid rent, naming rights, and concessions.
7474;;$50 million from corporate investments for naming rights and other benefits
7475;;The new baseball and basketball facilities in Cleveland also intensify the competition for potential sources of new revenues for the Browns, including advertising and naming rights, to identify just two examples.
7476;;Naming rights entails the selling of the "rights" to name a public facility (e.g., toll road).
7477;;Naming rights have migrated from sports stadiums and arenas to performing arts centers.
7478;;On Tuesday, February 25, 1997, the City Council discussed the offer of Qualcomm Incorporated to purchase the naming rights to the Stadium from the City for a period of 20 years.
7479;;Qualcomm pays the City $18 million in cash for the naming rights in May
748;;A jockey shall not ride in a race if more than 7 pounds overweight without the consent of a steward.
7480;;Financing may also involve dedicated revenue streams such as prepaid rent, naming rights, and concessions from end users of the facility.
7481;;The act specifies that the Authority owns the naming rights to the publicly-owned stadium and shall negotiate a full fair market value price for the sale or lease of such rights.
7482;;This is when private corporations pay for the right to have their name displayed on professional sports facilities.
7483;;Across the country, corporations have committed substantial financial resources to having their company's name put on the facility.
7484;;Revenue from naming rights should be considered a very viable option in building and operating the facility.
7485;;Comparing the architecture to other sites and analyzing the styles of pottery and their location in the fill of the site, Morris conjectured an earlier occupation of people related to Chaco Canyon to the south, and a later occupation of people related to the Mesa Verde region to the north.
7486;;The types of artifacts in the collection include the full range of Chacoan material culture -- prehistoric vessels, stone and bone tools, matting and sandals, ground stone tools for making corn flour, projectile points, hammers and mauls, hoes and digging sticks, corn cobs and turkey bones, and ornaments of shell, turquoise, jet, and bone.
7487;;Explore cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde, journey back in time to Chaco Canyon with its vast network of roads and its intriguing astronomical observatories
7488;;The Chacoan people used pottery for food preparation, serving, and storage.
7489;;Bowls, jars, canteens, seed jars, pitchers, and ladles came in a dazzling variety of shapes and sizes.
749;;Immediately after pulling up, a jockey shall ride to the place of weighing in, dismount after obtaining permission from the official in charge, and wait to be weighed by the clerk of the scales.
7490;;Although ceramics were present in the American Southwest by AD 200, clay cooking pots at Chaco first appear around AD 450 - 500.
7491;;As Chacoans became settled farmers, they built more permanent structures, and increasingly used ceramics.
7492;;Pottery was more durable, took less time to produce than basketry, and could be used over a fire for cooking.
7493;;The people of Chaco Canyon were farmers, hunters, and gatherers.
7494;;They made full use of the limited resources of their arid plateau and range desert environment.
7495;;In the early periods, [Archaic through Basketmaker, from about 5500 BC to AD 700], hunting provided most of the food.
7496;;Hunters needed large arrows or projectile points to successfully hunt large game such as mule deer, bison, mountain sheep, and elk.
7497;;During this period, points were mounted on spears.
7498;;The atlatl or spear thrower was used to increase thrust and propel the spear forward
7499;;Around AD 700, with the start of the Pueblo Period, bows and arrows began to replace the atlatl.
75;;Prices were generally improving in the mid-1990s.
750;;A jockey shall not intentionally touch any person or thing other than the jockey's own equipment before weighing in.
7500;;Projectile points diminished in size to fit the small reed arrow shafts.
7501;;The small projectile points were suited to hunting the small mammals and birds that were plentiful and easy to capture at Chaco.
7502;;The Chacoans practiced dry farming supplemented by water control management.
7503;;Canals, check dams, and ditches took advantage of the water runoff during summer storms.
7504;;Digging sticks and tchamahias or stone hoes were used for planting.
7505;;After the harvest, seeds were stored over the winter in seed jars.
7506;;Dried corn kernels were then ground into flour using manos or hand-held round or oval grinding stones and metates, large grinding slabs, often in a series of graduated coarseness.
7507;;Evidence indicates that ancient Chacoans flourished in this semiarid landscape on a varied diet of plants and animals, cultivated and wild.
7508;;The people of Chaco Canyon were master artisans, even though they only worked part-time on a range of crafts.
7509;;They left huge quantities of utilitarian and decorated ceramics, delicately carved pendants, beadwork, and refined stone artifacts such as projectile points.
751;;A jockey who is not able to ride to the place of weighing in because of an accident or illness which disables either the jockey or the horse shall walk or be assisted to the scales.
7510;;Color was important to the people of Chaco.
7511;;In addition to the colorful stones used for ornaments, minerals were ground into pigment for paints.
7512;;Hematite [red], limonite [yellow], azurite [blue], malachite [green], and gypsum [white] were ground on stone mortars.
7513;;They were then mixed with water or vegetal grease, and used to decorate objects, including arrows and other wooden items.
7514;;Pigments were also used to paint murals on plastered walls.
7515;;The Chaco Wash ran with water only seasonally.
7516;;Agriculture was always a risky business on the Colorado Plateau.
7517;;As a result, the Chacoans engaged in regional and long-distance trade.
7518;;Utilitarian goods were imported into Chaco from close by.
7519;;Ceramic wares came from the San Juan region to the north, the Chuska Mountains to the west, and the Zuni area to the south.
752;;If the overweight is more than one pound, the jockey shall declare the amount of the overweight to the clerk of scales no later than 45 minutes before post time.
7520;;Few pots were made in Chaco Canyon, probably because the demand for wood to construct the great houses depleted fuel sources needed to fire ceramics.
7521;;Workshops were common in Chaco.
7522;;Some archeologists have speculated that turquoise production helped make Chaco Canyon a ceremonial or religious center.
7523;;In Chaco Canyon, petroglyphs are carved into the sandstone cliffs that form the canyon walls.
7524;;Many are located on boulders.
7525;;Pictographs, images painted on a rock surface, are less common in Chaco Canyon because the paint erodes over time.
7526;;At Chaco, and throughout the American Southwest, rock images were probably an important form of visual communication.
7527;;Some are images of clan symbols; others are records of important events during migrations.
7528;;Still others are memory aids for recalling stories, songs, and ceremonies.
7529;;Today, descendants often recognize Chaco's petroglyphs and pictographs as records of the migrations of clans, and as other affirmations of meaningful and ongoing associations with sites.
753;;If the overweight exceeds 10 pounds, a substitute jockey must be named, except that an amateur jockey may carry more than 10 pounds of overweight.
7530;;Many Chacoan petroglyphs are geometric designs such as spirals, mazes, and hatching.
7531;;There are some depictions of stick figures or stylized humans, flute players, hands, sandals, mountain sheep, birds, and insects.
7532;;One of the most famous petroglyphs in Chaco Canyon is the Sun Dagger.
7533;;It consists of two spirals that mark the annual solstices and equinoxes.
7534;;More recent historic-era pictographs and petroglyphs depict scenes of dancers, men on horseback, and Navajo deities.
7535;;The Chaco people were skilled masons.
7536;;Working with stone tools, they erected vast communal buildings that still compel admiration.
7537;;Their masonry techniques evolved over centuries and archeologists can date sections of structures by masonry style.
7538;;The earliest dwellings were built with simple walls one stone thick, with generous courses of mud mortar.
7539;;Archeologists believe kivas developed out of earlier pit structures that were used as dwellings.
754;;If a horse is equipped with a martingale, breast-plate or yoke, then this equipment must be put on the scale and included in the jockeys' weight
7540;;Chacoan kivas have formal features like fire pits, floor vaults, wind deflectors, and benches, and contain evidence of domestic as well as ritual life.
7541;;In Chaco Canyon, clay pots were common by AD 450-500.
7542;;As Chacoans began to depend on agriculture as a primary food source, they became more settled.
7543;;A sedentary life style was conducive to building permanent structures, and the use of ceramics.
7544;;Chaco Canyon was a hub of ceremony, trade, and administration for the prehistoric Four Corners area.
7545;;The Chacoan people did not just "disappear" when they left the Four Corners area (shared state border area of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colrado) in the 13th century.
7546;;They migrated from this area, moving south, east and west to join relatives living on the Hopi mesas, along the Rio Grande and around Zuni Mountain.
7547;;Many clans trace a direct relationship to Chaco.
7548;;The Pueblos of Acoma, Zia, Cochiti, Laguna, San Felipe, Santo Domingo and Zuni all have oral traditions that tell of clans migrating from Chaco and the surrounding areas.
7549;;The cultural flowering of the Chacoan people began in the mid-800s and lasted for more than 300 years.
755;;If a jockey weighs in at less than the weight at which he weighed out, the horse shall be disqualified unless the stewards are satisfied that such shortness of weight was caused by exceptional circumstances.
7550;;Using masonry techniques unique for their time, they constructed massive stone buildings ("great houses") of multiple stories containing hundreds of rooms much larger than any they had previously built.
7551;;The buildings were planned from the start, in contrast to the usual practice of adding rooms to existing structures as needed.
7552;;Construction on some of these buildings spanned decades and even centuries.
7553;;In the 1100s and 1200s, change came to Chaco as new construction slowed and Chaco's role as a regional center shifted.
7554;;Chaco's influence continued at Aztec, Mesa Verde, the Chuska Mountains, and other centers to the north, south, and west.
7555;;In time, the people shifted away from Chacoan ways, migrated to new areas, reorganized their world, and eventually interacted with foreign cultures.
7556;;Chaco Canyon is a large canyon which contains approximately 1100 ruins including 13 major Pueblo Indian villages.
7557;;These villages consist of 3-5 story buildings which often contain over 1,000 rooms.
7558;;Dendrochronology revealed that one beam was made from a Douglas-fir tree cut in AD 1103 meaning the room was built after that date
7559;;Chaco is remarkable for its multi-story dwellings, which required considerable planning, organization, management and gathering of resources for their construction.
756;;A jockey's weight is measured against the jockey's assigned weight as published in the official race program.
7560;;The dwellings show evidence of a knowledge of astronomy.
7561;;The dwellings were carefully oriented with the extensive road system.
7562;;The roads were engineered, not merely worn footpaths, and their alignment shows planning.
7563;;The people of Chaco Canyon also traded for non-utilitarian goods, sometimes called 'exotic goods.'
7564;;American Indian peoples have continuously occupied the Colorado Plateau of the Southwest for over 10,000 years.
7565;;American Indian peoples have continuously occupied the Colorado Plateau of the Southwest for over 10,000 years.
7566;;From about AD 1000 - 1150, Chacoan culture presided over much of the Four Corners region.
7567;;The Chacoan people created an urban center of spectacular public architecture by employing formal design, astronomical alignments, geometry, unique masonry, landscaping, and engineering techniques that allowed multi-storied construction for the first time in the American Southwest.
7568;;The people built monumental public and ceremonial buildings in the canyon.
7569;;The buildings were massive, multi-storied masonry structures of rooms, kivas, terraces, and plazas.
757;;A jockey shall not weigh more than one pound less than the jockey's assigned weight published in the official program.
7570;;The largest building-Pueblo Bonito-is estimated to have contained over 600 rooms and rose four, possibly five, stories high.
7571;;Hundreds of miles of formal roads radiated out from the canyon and linked Chaco to distant communities.
7572;;Today, their descendants are members of 20 Indian tribes in New Mexico and Arizona.
7573;;Chaco Canyon served as a major urban center of ancestral Puebloan culture.
7574;;Remarkable for its monumental public and ceremonial buildings, engineering projects, astronomy, artistic achievements, and distinctive architecture, it served as a hub of ceremony, trade, and administration for the prehistoric Four Corners area for 400 years--unlike anything before or since.
7575;;American Indian peoples have continuously occupied the Colorado Plateau and the Four Corners Region of the Southwest for over 10,000 years.
7576;;Today, their descendants are members of 20 Indian tribes in New Mexico and Arizona.
7577;;From about AD 1000-1150, the Chaco Anasazi dominated the region.
7578;;They built great houses, kivas, round, semi-subterranean rooms used for social activities and ceremonies, and distinctive roads.
7579;;The great houses were massive, multi-storied masonry structures of rooms, kivas, terraces, and plazas.
758;;A jockey shall declare the amount of overweight at the time of weighing out
7580;;The largest, Pueblo Bonito, is estimated to have contained over 600 rooms and risen four, possibly five, stories high.
7581;;The Chacoan people created an urban center of spectacular public architecture by employing formal design, astronomical alignments, geometry, core-and-veneer masonry styles, landscaping, and engineering techniques that allowed multi-storied construction for the first time in the American Southwest.
7582;;Chaco Canyon was a major center of ancestral Puebloan culture between AD 850 and 1250.
7583;;It was a hub of ceremony, trade, and administration for the prehistoric Four Corners area - unlike anything before or since.
7584;;Chaco is remarkable for its monumental public and ceremonial buildings, and its distinctive architecture.
7585;;To construct the buildings, along with the associated Chacoan roads, ramps, dams, and mounds, required a great deal of well organized and skillful planning, designing, resource gathering, and construction.
7586;;The Chacoan people combined pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering to create an ancient urban center of spectacular public architecture - one that still amazes and inspires us a thousand years later.
7587;;Chaco Canyon emerged in the mid 900s as an essential component of the entire ecosystem, integral to and supported by the network of trade links due to its central location, the development of the society was, thus, no longer limited by the carrying capacity of the canyon environment and the population was able to expand as illustrated, today, by the large number of archaeological sites from this period.
7588;;At the peak of the Bonito Phase (1100 -1200 AD), the trade links may have expanded to include formal economic ties with areas as distant as Mexico in an effort to increase system stability.
7589;;Its demise around 1200 AD is seen as a function of environmental perturbations at the peripheral sites, initiating resource depletion to a degree which exceeded the limits of the system as a whole.
759;;A jockey shall not ride in a race if more than two pounds overweight without the consent of the owner or trainer of the horse the jockey is to ride
7590;;The beginning of human occupation in the Chaco Canyon area began around 8,000 years ago.
7591;;At that time, people lived in temporary campsites as they moved around to seasonal food source areas.
7592;;These sites are identified by the characteristic artifacts found at them including stone tools, the bones of game animals, and heatcracked rock from fires.
7593;;People secured better control over their food supply when domesticated crops were introduced around 1000 B.C.
7594;;By A.D. 400, corn, beans, and squash were staples of the prehistoric diet.
7595;;The increase in agricultural production allowed the population to grow and led to a more settled way of life in small villages.
7596;;Pithouse plan At that time, dwellings consisted of circular subterranean pit houses with above-ground storage pits often clustered in small groups.
7597;;People continued to live in this way for several centuries, but by A.D. 1000 another transition occurred.
7598;;During the middle and late 800s, the great houses of Pueblo Bonito, Una Vida, and Peï¿½asco Blanco were constructed, followed by Hungo Pavi, Chetro Ketl, Pueblo Alto, and others.
7599;;These structures were often oriented to solar, lunar, and cardinal directions.
76;;Offshore work requires a large and complex onshore support structure, larger than the OCS industry itself.

7600;;Lines of sight between the great houses allowed communication.
7601;;Sophisticated astronomical markers, communication features, water control devices, and formal earthen mounds surrounded them.
7602;;The buildings were placed within a landscape surrounded by sacred mountains, mesas, and shrines that still have deep spiritual meaning for American Indian descendants.
7603;;By 1050, Chaco had become the ceremonial, administrative, and economic center of the San Juan Basin.
7604;;Its sphere of influence was extensive.
7605;;Dozens of great houses in Chaco Canyon were connected by roads to over 150 great houses built throughout the region.
7606;;It is thought that the great houses were not traditional farming villages occupied by large populations.
7607;;They may instead have been impressive examples of "public architecture" that were used periodically during times of ceremony, commerce, and trading when temporary populations came to the canyon for these events.
7608;;A thousand years ago, the Chacoan people planned ceremonial events and agricultural planting according to celestial observations.
7609;;: Colonies of red and black imported fire ants become territorial as they grow; they defend an area against all other fire ants.
761;;Immediately after pulling up, a jockey shall ride to the place of weighing in, dismount after obtaining permission from the official in charge, and wait to be weighed by the clerk of the scales.
7610;;Therefore, fire ant colony populations often reach an upper limit depending on the territory size of mature colonies.
7611;;A typical figure for pasture land seems to be about 20-50 mounds per acre in single queen nests and up to 250 mounds or more in multiple queen nests.
7612;;Mature colonies of imported red fire ants consist of an average 80,000 workers, but colonies of up to 240,000 and more have been reported.
7613;;In addition to very hot or boiling water, other "home remedies" have been tried.
7614;;While these methods sometimes appear to work, they rarely eliminate colonies.
7615;;Usually, the ant colony simply moves to a new location, or the queen and a few workers temporarily remain hidden underground.
7616;;Update Hot on the Trail of Fire Ants Red imported fire ants keep adapting to life in the United States.
7617;;They keep spreading farther and farther north from their foothold in the Southeast, often overtaking native ants along the way to become the dominant species.
7618;;They keep spreading farther and farther north from their foothold in the Southeast, often overtaking native ants along the way to become the dominant species.
7619;;Fish farmers typically work barefoot along the pond banks and because the banks provide an ideal habitat for fire ant colonies, the probability of being stung is very high.
762;;A jockey shall not intentionally touch any person or thing other than the jockey's own equipment before weighing in.
7620;;There are three major ways to manage fire ants with chemicals: treating individual mounds, broadcast treatment of a large area, and spot treatment in and around structures.
7621;;The red imported fire ant builds mounds that are, on average, 10"-24" in diameter and 18" high.
7622;;But larger mounds are not uncommon.
7623;;They also may extend 6' underground.
7624;;A mature colony of red imported fire ants can produce as many as 4,500 reproductives during the year in 6-10 mating flights between spring and fall.
7625;;Nearly 100,000 queens may be produced per acre in heavily infested land, but mortality rates, mostly from predators, can reach 99%.
7626;;Some researchers believe it may be best to selectively control fire ant colonies- -allowing native species to flourish as a way to prevent the introduction of the imported species, or leaving single queen imports alone to prevent the area from invasion by a multiple-queen "supercolony."
7627;;A number of biological enemies of the fire ants have been evaluated as biocontrol agents, including nematodes, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and microsporidia.
7628;;Some show promise, but biological control is not yet a proven effective control tactic for fire ants.
7629;;Fire ants, like other ants, may be nesting near buildings and can enter and move through a structure through innumerable tiny cracks and openings.
763;;A jockey who is not able to ride to the place of weighing in because of an accident or illness which disables either the jockey or the horse shall walk or be assisted to the scales.
7630;;Caulking and otherwise sealing cracks and crevices being used by fire ants can often have great effect in suppressing the population inside.
7631;;Many effective, easy-to-use silicon sealers and expandable caulk products have been recently developed, including some designed specifically for pest management.
7632;;There are three major ways to manage fire ants with chemicals: treating individual mounds, broadcast treatment of a large area, and spot treatment in and around structures.
7633;;Several different types of products are labeled for application over wide areas to control fire ants.
7634;;Granular insecticides are often applied with hand-operated fertilizer spreaders or agricultural application equipment.
7635;;Sprays also are sometimes used.
7636;;A better choice is broadcast treatment with an insect growth regulator bait, which poses much less risks to nontarget species.
7637;;Chemicals provide only temporary control of fire ants and must be reapplied periodically for as long as control is desired.
7638;;Insecticides are not specific to the red imported fire ant.
7639;;They may also eliminate native ants and other non-target organisms.
764;;A jockey shall not pass the scale more than seven pounds overweight without the consent of the stewards.
7640;;No product is registered for use in all the sites where fire ants thrive.
7641;;As a result, reinfestation is likely to occur if treatments are terminated; new populations may be larger than before treatment.Because of this, the decision to treat fire ants must be accompanied by a longterm commitment to continue periodic treatments.
7642;;One device is designed to electrocute fire ant workers as they climb onto an electric grid inserted into the mound.
7643;;It will kill many worker ants, but the queens and brood are unaffected.
7644;;Approximately $2 billion in damage, including costs for insecticide for fire ant suppression and eradication, is caused by IFA in the United States each year.
7645;;In 1958, the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA, APHIS), enacted a Federal Imported Fire Ant Quarantine (7CFR301) to slow the artificial spread of Imported Fire Ants from fire ant infested (quarantined) areas to non-infested (non-quarantined) areas.
7646;;The Imported Fire Ant Quarantine includes all of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Puerto Rico, most of South Carolina, and parts of Arkansas, California, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee.
7647;;A number of organisms kill newly-mated fire ant queens.
7648;;These include dragonflies, other ants, some types of birds, lizards, spiders and toads.
7649;;Animals that eat ants, such as armadillos, may disturb mounds and eat some workers, but they are not really useful in control
765;;A jockey shall not be more than one pound short at weigh in.
7650;;Pouring very hot or boiling water on a mound is a fairly effective treatment, particularly at times when ants are close to the mound surface, such as on a cool, sunny morning.

7654;;Fire ants invade compost piles and mulched flower beds seeking warmth and moisture.
7655;;They also nest under cracked pavement, removing dirt from underneath sidewalks and roadways and aggravating structural problems.
7656;;Colonies in these sites may be difficult to locate precisely.
7657;;When the exact location of a fire ant colony is unknown, treat the area of greatest ant activity with a fast-acting bait product such as hydramethylnon
7658;;A number of organisms kill newly-mated fire ant queens.

7660;;Animals that eat ants, such as armadillos, may disturb mounds and eat some workers, but they are not really useful in control
7661;;The predatory straw-itch mite, Pyemotes tritici (Lagreze-Fossat & Montane), that feeds on and paralyzes developing fire ants is not effective when applied as directed and is potentially hazardous to the user
7662;;Parasitic nematodes (Steinernema spp.) are roundworms that seek out and enter insects, paralyzing them and developing in their bodies.
7663;;Species and strains vary in their effectiveness.
7664;;Strains tested to date caused ants in treated mounds to temporarily move away from the treated mound, but few colonies were actually eliminated.
7665;;Parasitic fungi (Beuvaria bassiana) are also being evaluated as individual mound treatments.
7666;;The most effective biological control organisms for large-scale programs will likely be those that spread from mound to mound.
7667;;Several are being evaluated for control, including flies, Strepsiptera and parasitic wasps.
7668;;It is hoped that introducing natural enemies of fire ants to the U.S. may someday help to control them, although natural enemies will not eliminate fire ants.
7669;;In South America, where fire ants have many natural enemies, the ants are still present

7671;;One device is designed to electrocute fire ant workers as they climb onto an electric grid inserted into the mound.
7672;;It will kill many worker ants, but the queens and brood are unaffected.
7673;;There are vibrating and sound-producing units designed to repel colonies, and devices that use microwaves or explosive elements to heat mounds or blow them up.
7674;;Gasoline and other petroleum products do kill fire ant colonies.
7675;;However, petroleum products are dangerously flammable, kill grass and plants around the treated mounds, and can seriously pollute the soil and ground water.
7676;;Soap solutions, cleaning products or wood ashes soaked into the mound are believed to remove the protective oil coating from the ants.
7677;;Use of battery acids, bleaches or ammonia products can be dangerous and is strongly discouraged, except when they are ingredients in a registered pesticide product accompanied by usage directions.
7678;;Some natural substances found in crushed or grated citrus peels are reported to be toxic to fire ants.
7679;;However, until proper formulations and application techniques for these naturally-occurring chemicals are developed, they are unlikely to be effective
768;;Factors that may affect more localized urban travel include changes in security procedures that affect public transit and parking facilities.
7680;;Several products said to be "organic" (of natural origin) are currently marketed for fire ant control (see Table 1, Botanicals section, p. 18).
7681;;All of these products are registered by the Environmental Protection Agency as pesticides and some are very effective.
7682;;In addition to baits, mound treatment insecticides are formulated as dusts, liquids, granules and aerosols.
7683;;Their effectiveness depends on proper application.
7684;;Some products, such as those containing acephate (Orthene^ï¿½), are specially labeled for dusting individual fire ant mounds.
7685;;Products containing pyrethrins, resmethrin, tetramethrin or chlorpyrifos are manufactured in special aerosol containers to which an injection rod is attached.
7686;;Products used to treat ant trails and colonies located in wall voids are usually dusts or sprays, although some are insecticide-latex paint mixtures.
7687;;Granular insecticides are applied with fertilizer spreaders.

7689;;More than 60 years ago, the red imported fire ant was accidentally brought into Mobile, Alabama from South America.
769;;In several areas of the country, parking facilities have been closed or security enhanced in order to restrict access.
7690;;It now infests more than 260 million acres comprising most of nine southeastern states and Puerto Rico.
7691;;It reached Texas during the 1950s and spread steadily across the state.
7692;;Fire ants can travel long distances when newly-mated queens land on cars, trucks or trains.
7693;;Shipments of nursery stock or soil from an infested area may relocate entire colonies or nests.
7694;;The fire ant presently infests the eastern two-thirds of Texas and continues to spread westward
7695;;This material mimics the effects of the insect's own juvenile hormone, reducing the production of viable eggs and preventing the development of worker ants for up to a year after application
7696;;These plant-derived products are contact insecticides and have various modes of action.
7697;;Pyrethrins, which act on the nerve axon, kill ants quickly (within minutes to hours) and can be used as mound treatments or surface sprays.
7698;;Like pyrethrins, these products destabilize nerve cell membranes and kill quickly, but are quickly deactivated and have little residual activity.
7699;;They are contact insecticides applied as aerosol injections, mound drenches or surface sprays
77;;This includes: manufacturing companies, fabrication yards, chemical plants, supply bases, boat and helicopter charters, law and engineering firms, caterers, truckers.
770;;The fear that vehicles loaded with explosives could damage adjacent facilities or gatherings have resulted in changes in parking policy and locations in numerous areas.
7700;;Pyrethroids (bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, fluvalinate, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, s-bioallethrin, s-fenvalerate, tefluthrin, tralomethrin) These products also destabilize nerve cell membranes.
7701;;They can persist in the environment longer than pyrethrins and their derivatives.
7702;;They are relatively quick-killing contact insecticides applied as mound drenches, dusts or surface sprays and granules
7703;;This bait product is derived from a soil fungus and inhibits nerve transmission.
7704;;As a mound treatment it kills worker ants and colonies quickly, but as a broadcast treatment it acts more like an insect growth regulator, preventing the production of viable eggs.
7705;;These materials disrupt nerve transmission (cholinesterase inhibitor).
7706;;They are relatively quick-killing contact insecticides used as mound drenches and surface sprays
7707;;Organophosphates (acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, fenthion, isofenphos, malathion, propetamphos, propoxur, trichlorfon) These products also interfere with nerve cell transmission (cholinesterase inhibitor).
7708;;They are relatively quick-killing contact insecticides formulated as aerosols, liquids, dusts or granules and applied as mound treatments or surface applications.
7709;;Hydramethylnon (amidinohydrazone) and sulfonamide kill ants by preventing them from converting food into energy.
771;;Factors that may affect more localized urban travel include changes in security procedures that affect public transit and parking facilities.
7710;;Diatomaceous earth (D.E., silicone dioxide) products are usually applied as contact insecticides to ant trails indoors.
7711;;D.E. abrades the waxy layer from the insect exoskeleton, causing the insect to desiccate.
7712;;The development of a new method of control using a bait-toxicant system revolutionized not only the type of control, but also the type of chemicals that could be used in such a system.
7713;;March, 1983 great deal concerning this insect, new noninsecticidal control techniques and strategies have not been developed as yet.
7714;;In addition, two other chemicals EL-468 and avermectin BIa have shown promise and the former is near the commercial development stage.
7715;;Also, research in developing bait-toxicants which will be species specific is actively being pursued and although progress is slow the future looks promising in this area.
7716;;Other examples of biological controls are a fungus that grows inside adult ants eventually killing them, and a parasitic ant that attaches to the imported fire ant queen in order to divert food from worker ants to itself
7717;;broadcast of bait that will be picked up by worker ants and eventually given the queen; and treatment of mounds individually with chemical or nonchemical substances.
7718;;One much-discussed biological control is a Brazilian speciesspecific parasitic phorid fly that seeks out and lays eggs on imported fire ants.
7719;;A maggot soon hatches and migrates to the ant's head, consumes its contents, pupates, and creates enzymes that dissolve the ant's connective tissue, causing its head to fall off.
772;;In several areas of the country, parking facilities have been closed or security enhanced in order to restrict access.
7720;;Other examples of biological controls are a fungus that grows inside adult ants eventually killing them, and a parasitic ant that attaches to the imported fire ant queen in order to divert food from worker ants to itself
7721;;Species of ants that sting, such as red imported fire ants, can endanger young children, confined pets and bedridden people.
7722;;Foraging workers of some ants establish temporary chemical (pheromone) trails that help other ants find food and water.
7723;;These species can "recruit" other ants to a resource quickly and in high numbers.
7724;;Food is brought back to the colony and fed communally among the other members of the colony, including the queen(s) and brood, a process called trophallaxis.
7725;;Fire ant losses total almost $6 billion a year in urban and agricultural areas.
7726;;And the only way to maintain control has been to apply insecticides two to four times a year at a cost of at least $10 an acre for each treatment.
7727;;Treating all infested land would cost $6 billion to $12 billion a year.
7728;;Decapitating phorid flies not only remove ants' heads, they weaken colonies because remaining ants -- trying to avoid fly attack -- stop looking for food outside their nest.
7729;;Female flies are released near mounds, attack ants, and lay eggs inside them.
773;;The fear that vehicles loaded with explosives could damage adjacent facilities or gatherings have resulted in changes in parking policy and locations in numerous areas.
7730;;The egg hatches into a tiny maggot that burrows into the ant head.
7731;;Inside the head, the maggot causes the fire ant head to fall off, killing the ant
7732;;Fire ant disease weakens fire ant colonies and results in 60 percent fewer ants per acre.
7733;;Researchers place infected larvae on the fire ant mound.
7734;;Ants adopt and raise infected larvae.
7735;;The disease spreads to workers and the queen.
7736;;In the queen, the disease multiplies, causing the abdomen to shrink.
7737;;Two pathogens from South America in Buenos Aires, Argentina--where it is are known to infect fire ant colonies, and being studied in the field--to examine research is continuing into their effecthe pathogen under quarantine in tiveness as biological control agents.
7738;;This single-celled Pereira.

7742;;protozoan from the genus Mattesia was Agricultural Research/February 2003 present in 34 percent of sites and 8 percent of nests studied in Florida.
7743;;The pathogen causes extreme changes in appearance, but its full impact as a potential biological control agent is still under investigation.
7744;;Just their presence keeps frightened ants from leaving their mounds.
7745;;A female fly hovers over a mound before she pinpoints a victim, dive-bombs it, and deposits one of her eggs inside it.
7746;;The egg, as researchers at the center discovered, eventually produces a larva that eats its way to the head and causes it to fall off.
7747;;Baits are a very effective, but expensive, method of controlling existing fire ant colonies.
7748;;USDA-ARS has worked to make oilbased baits commercially available to the public.
7749;;Fire ant carries bait back to the mound Baits do not harm wildlife because they break down in sunlight.
775;;For example, several states are considering high-speed rail networks that are being designed to have direct convenient access to airports.
7750;;Two baits are combined to provide fast-acting and longterm control of fire ants.
7751;;Hydramethylnon bait kills ants within three to five weeks.
7752;;Methoprene bait sterilizes ant reproductives and prevents larvae from developing normally.
7753;;A decapitating fly, Pseudacteon tricuspis, attacks fire ant workers and causes them to hide instead of feed.
7754;;Female flies lay eggs that develop inside the fire ant head, causing the head to fall off.
7755;;Adult flies emerge from the severed head and attack other fire ants.
7756;;A fire ant disease, Thelohania solenopsae, is introduced into colonies by putting infected fire ant larvae in the mound.
7757;;The disease is caused by a protozoan that weakens the colony.
7758;;Weakened colonies mean fewer fire ant reproductives to start new colonies.
7759;;However, it does seem likely that parasites and pathogens may work in concert with the effects of corn petition from other species of ants.
776;;To the extent that direct connections require that all rail passenger undergo the same level of security review as airline passengers, then the concept of an integrated system requires the air travel security precautions to be applied to all rail travelers that would have access to the rail-air transfer station.
7760;;If this is true, then the introduction of natural enemies might only need to put a relatively small stress on the productivity of fire ant colonies to tilt the ecological balance in favor of native ant species.
7761;;We have demonstrated that a new pesticide, fipronil, is effective against fire ants in California.
7762;;This product has a much longer residual effectthan other pesticides, thus reducing the frequency of treatments (once a year instead of4 times a year, according to experts who have tested it in other states).
7763;;The fipronil does not require turning off irrigation, as do other fire ant products.
7764;;Fipronil will soon be on the market in California and will be available for fire ant control
7765;;A female fly hovers over a mound before she pinpoints a victim, dive-bombs it, and deposits one of her eggs inside it.
7766;;The egg, as researchers at the center discovered, eventually produces a larva that eats its way to the head and causes it to fall off.
7767;;Damage and control costs are estimated to be more than $6.5 billion a year.
7768;;Red imported fire ants currently infest more than 320 million acres in 12 southeastern states and Puerto Rico and have recently spread to California and New Mexico.
7769;;Black imported fire ants, Solenopsis richteri, introduced to the United States in 1918, are less widespread.
777;;For example, several states are considering high-speed rail networks that are being designed to have direct convenient access to airports.
7770;;Two pathogens from South America are known to infect fire ant colonies, and research is continuing into their effectiveness as biological control agents.
7771;;CMAVE researchers were the first to discover Thelohania solenopsae in the United States in 1996.
7772;;This single-celled protozoan parasite infects colonies when workers transfer it to the queen, possibly through food exchange.
7773;;It reduces the queen's weight, and she lays fewer eggs.
7774;;Colonies die out after 9 to 18 months.
7775;;The researchers are studying another pathogen, Vairimorpha invictae, that is more lethal but also more rare than T. solenopsae.

7781;;The egg, as researchers at the center discovered, eventually produces a larva that eats its way to the head and causes it to fall off.
7782;;The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), occurs in densities at least five times greater in the southern and southeastern United States than in its native South American habitat (Porter and Savignano, 1990; Porter et al., 1992).
7783;;This large biomass of aggressive fire ants dominates the ecological community (Porter and Savignano, 1990) and interferes with human activities
7784;;Tiny Brazilian phorid flies, Pseudacteon tricuspis, were released at sites in Gainesville, Florida.
7785;;Phorid flies are deadly enemies of fire ants, stinging them and depositing eggs inside their bodies.
7786;;Each fly larva eventually grows and moves into the host ant's head.
7787;;When the larva is mature, it decapitates the ant and completes its development inside the severed head.
7788;;ARS scientists, in cooperation with Arkansas officials, released fire ant larvae infected with Thelohania solenopsae, a microorganism from South America that infects fire ant colonies and chronically weakens them.
7789;;Unsuspecting worker ants transfer the pathogen to the queen through food exchange.
779;;As you may be aware, the Project PROTECT chemical detection system, which is being prototyped in the Washington D.C. subway system, is an example of the kind of technology that may be adapted for use in transit security.
7790;;The disease slowly reduces her weight and the number of eggs she lays.
7791;;The pathogen ultimately infects all workers, eventually weakening the colony and causing its demise
7792;;Tropical fish farms provide a prime habitat for the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, which is an invasive, stinging ant that has spread throughout the southern United States
7793;;Areas around fish ponds were treated with a fire ant bait that contained the insect growth regulator methoprene.
7794;;This bait was selected because of its low toxicity to fish and that methoprene formulations are used for mosquito control in aquatic ecosystems.
7795;;Fire ant nest densities declined 57% within 4 months.
7796;;In contrast, nest densities increased 86% in untreated areas.
7797;;Fire ant populations declined an average of 68% and increased 110% during the summer for treated and untreated areas, respectively
7798;;If wildlife breeding areas are considered non-agricultural lands, fire ants on these lands can be treated with insecticide products registered for this kind of usage
7799;;This program relies on the periodic (annual, semi-annual) broadcast application of an effective fire ant bait product.
78;;At the beginning of this century, in January of 1901, when the historic Spindletop well gushed its first of many millions of barrels of oil, the Texas oil industry was in its infancy, and the price of oil soon plummeted to a mere three cents per barrel.
780;;Public transportation agencies around the nation have stepped up security efforts in the wake of September 11^th.
7800;;These treatments can reduce mound numbers by up to 90 percent, but reduction requires several weeks to months to achieve, depending upon the product chosen, e.g., Amdroï¿½ (hyrdamethylnon), the only bait product currently registered for use in cattle pastures takes 3 to 6 weeks
7801;;One potential parasite being investigated is a phorid fly which develops inside the heads of ants.
7802;;Thelohania solenopsae, a microorganism from South America, infects fire ant colonies and causes disease.
7803;;Williams says workers probably transfer the pathogen to the queen through food exchange.
7804;;As the disease slowly reduces her weight, she lays fewer and fewer eggs, and all are infected with the pathogen, further weakening the colony.
7805;;Williams says colonies generally die within 9 to 18 months.
7806;;Even more powerful than Thelohania is another pathogen called Vairimorpha, which Williams says is not that different.
7807;;When combined with Thelohania, it kills colonies in 2 to 6 weeks.
7808;;Another line of defense that "has fire ants literally on the run is the phorid fly, Pseudacteon tricuspus, their mortal enemies," says ARS entomologist Sanford D. Porter.
7809;;"The ants will run and hide, freeze, stop foraging, or twist upside down so the flies don't sting them.
781;;Many have increased the number of security personnel in stations and on transit vehicles, purchased protective equipment for transit personnel who will be the first to respond in an emergency, removing trash receptacles where explosives could be hidden, and reminding the public how they can help.
7810;;The phorid flies hover over the fire ant mound, then zoom in to pierce an ant's outer cuticle and deposit an egg underneath.
7811;;The egg quickly hatches into a fly maggot, or larva, that moves into the ant's head.

7815;;To begin with, imported fire ants, or IFA, were introduced into the southern United States 60 to 80 years ago.
7816;;After the ants were first observed around 1920, landowners in infested areas began applying available insecticides such as calcium cyanide dust.
7817;;The original program was a cooperative effort between APHIS and the states in three areas including detection, confining and eradicating isolated infestations, regulatory activity to slow IFA's spread by controlling the movement of regulated articles and, finally, control activity to reduce populations using wide area pesticide applications

7833;;The Department of Highways and Public Transportation has an ongoing program to control Red Imported Fire Ants (RIFA) within its rights-of-way in the following priority areas: 1.
7834;;SCDHPT Property adjacent to service buildings that the public uses on a daily basis.
7835;;Public rest areas and welcome centers maintained by SCDHPT.
7836;;Rural Right-of-Way adjacent to recreation areas.
7837;;Rural Interstate Interchanges adjacent to built up areas.
7838;;Right-of-Way in high density urban areas in cooperation with adjacent land owners.
7839;;We are presently using AMDRO bait as the primary treatment product.
784;;Four main categories are: ï¿½ hardware and equipment ï¿½ design and environment ï¿½ community education and judicial policies ï¿½ personnel and operations
7840;;We also are experimenting with CESSCO and ORTHANE 75.
7841;;Lower egg laying rates, queen weights, and queen survivorship was also documented from infected colonies.
7842;;Thus, T. solenopsae slowly debilitates an S. invicta queen so that reproductive capacity diminishes and early death results.
7843;;Recently there has been interest in biological control agents for imported ï¿½re ants in the United States
7844;;Thelohania solenopsae, a microorganism from South America, infects fire ant colonies and causes disease.
7845;;Williams says workers probably transfer the pathogen to the queen through food exchange.
7846;;As the disease slowly reduces her weight, she lays fewer and fewer eggs, and all are infected with the pathogen, further weakening the colony.
7847;;Williams says colonies generally die within 9 to 18 months.
7848;;Even more powerful than Thelohania is another pathogen called Vairimorpha, which Williams says is not that different.
7849;;When combined with Thelohania, it kills colonies in 2 to 6 weeks.
785;;Hardware and Equipment Countermeasures Items in this category can include: ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ alarm systems communication devices--phones, two-way radios, public address systems surveillance equipment including closed circuit television (CCTV), security mirrors, visual and auditory monitoring, and teleview alert systems (TVA) evidence gathering equipment such as alarm activated cameras and videotape entry control such as turnstiles and gates, prescreening riders, and automatically sealed exits fare hardening devices including exact change systems and sealed fareboxes, and detection devices (metal detectors and intrusion detectors
7850;;Another line of defense that "has fire ants literally on the run is the phorid fly, Pseudacteon tricuspus, their mortal enemies," says ARS entomologist Sanford D. Porter.
7851;;"The ants will run and hide, freeze, stop foraging, or twist upside down so the flies don't sting them.
7852;;The phorid flies hover over the fire ant mound, then zoom in to pierce an ant's outer cuticle and deposit an egg underneath.
7853;;The egg quickly hatches into a fly maggot, or larva, that moves into the ant's head.
7854;;When the maggot is mature, it releases an enzyme that causes the ant's head to fall off--decapitation.
7855;;Although the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is more well-known to most Americans because it infests a larger area, the black imported fire ant, S. richteri, actually arrived here first, back in 1918.
7856;;They are currently found only in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee
7857;;One agent under study is Thelohania solenopsae, a single-celled protozoan parasite first isolated by ARS scientists at Gainesville.

7869;;They reduce the biological diversity of ecosystems, damage crops, and are a medical and veterinary concern because of their painful, venomous sting.
787;;This approach focuses on how the built environment can encourage or prevent the commission of acts of crime and vandalism.
7870;;The economic impact of fire ants in seven southern states has been reported to be over half a billion dollars per year.
7871;;Recently, a pathogen of fire ants from South America, Thelohania solenopsae, was found in limited locations in the U.S.
7872;;In contrast to the previous fire ant biological control agents, T. solenopsae is self-sustaining, and directly debilitates the fire ant queen by infecting her ovaries.
7873;;The infection results in reduced egg production, and eventually causes premature death of the queen
7874;;The black imported fire ant, Solenopsis richteri, is very similar to the red imported fire ant.
7875;;It is currently limited to a small area of northern Mississippi and Alabama.
7876;;Boiling water has been added to individual mounds with varying degrees of success reported.
7877;;Approximately 3 gallons of hot water poured into each mound will eliminate about 60% of the mounds treated.
7878;;Mounds can be dug up and moved or destroyed, but not without some risk that the fire ants will successfully attack the digger.
7879;;Dragging, or knocking down, mounds may provide a limited level of control, but only if mounds are dragged just before the first hard freeze.
788;;Oscar Newman's concept of defensible space forms a basis for this approach, and involves arrangements of buildings and spaces to foster a sense of control and cohesiveness among residents of a community to give an image of solidarity and property to outsiders
7880;;So far, the most effective of these is a nematode, Neoaplectana carpocapsae.
7881;;In trials, one application has inactivated about 80% of treated mounds in 90 days.
7882;;The straw itch mite, Pyemotes tritici, has also been shown to inactivate fire ant mounds.
7883;;Three to ten applications at about two week intervals gave 70% control.
7884;;Treating individual ant mounds is time consuming, but it is generally the most effective method of control.
7885;;It takes from a few hours to a few weeks to "kill" the mound, depending on the product used.
7886;;A few bait products are available that may be used for individual mound treatments.
7887;;The baits take from several days to several weeks to eliminate a fire ant colony, but they can be very effective and are simple to use.

7890;;The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Buren), is an introduced species that arrived in Mobile, Alabama from South America around the 1920s.
7891;;This species has had an enormous impact in the southeastern United States, and continues to spread into areas of North America with mild climates and adequate moisture and food.
7892;;Various mechanical and electrical products have been marketed for fire ant control.
7893;;Wright said the most economical and ecological means of controlling fire ants is by using poison bait.
7894;;The bait is taken into the mound but takes three to four weeks for results.
7895;;He said the best new chemical control product is Thiomethoxan, which looks promising but is not yet licensed in Oklahoma.
7896;;Research indicates the potion knocks fire ants down in a day and keeps them down for approximately 35 days, he said
7897;;Imported Fire Ants (IFA) were accidentally introduced into the United States from South America, beginning in about 1918.
7898;;Solenopsis richteri or the black IFA was the first of two species of fire ants to be introduced via shipping into Mobile, Alabama.
7899;;Another species of fire ant (Solenopsis invicta or the red IFA) also became established in the Mobile area by the early 1940's.

7900;;The most common of the two species is the red IFA, which is now established in all or part of 13 states and Puerto Rico.
7901;;The black IFA is found in a relatively small area comprising a part of northeastern Mississippi, northwestern Alabama, and southern Tennessee, with a hybrid of the red and black IFA being found near this region.
7902;;Conventional bait formulations combine pesticide ingredients with processed corn grit coated with soybean oil.
7903;;Granular products containing carbaryl plus metaldehyde are registered for ants foraging in the garden.
7904;;Products containing diazinon or chlorpyrifos are registered for soil insects in home gardens; they can be applied before planting and may provide some temporary control of foraging fire ants.
7905;;Ant mounds can be shoveled out of the garden or treated with very hot water, taking care not to disturb or treat the garden plants.
7906;;To prevent ants from entering a garden, apply diazinon or chlorpyrifos spray or granules around the perimeter of the garden as a barrier, and treat individual mounds near the garden as needed.
7907;;Some parasites and pathogens are known to attack ants, and several have been marketed for fire ant control.

7912;;Boric acid is a slow-acting stomach poison.
7913;;It is commonly formulated as a dust or liquid bait for control of ants.
7914;;The red imported fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invieta Buren, and the black imported fire ant, Solenopsis richteri Forel were introduced into the United States at Mobile, Alabama, about 40 to 60 years ago.
7915;;The ants spread rapidly from this initial port of entry and now infest all or parts of 9 states and Puerto Rico.
7916;;The most economically feasible and environmentally least damaging treatment for the imported fire ant over large area-wide treatments is the use of the bait toxicant system for control.
7917;;Although there are several species of native fire ants in the United States, it is two non-native species accidentally brought to this country around 1920 that are of paramount concern.
7918;;Both the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) and the black imported fire ant (Solenopsis richteri) were probably introduced through ballast or dunnage on freight ships arriving in Mobile, Alabama from South America.
7919;;They are concentrated in southeastern states because their migration northward is hampered by cold weather extremes, and their westward expansion is slowed by dry desert climates.

7920;;Imported fire ants are currently found in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
7921;;The red imported fire ant is believed to have arrived in the 1930s from South America to a port in Mississippi.
7922;;Their march has been relentless northward across the southern United States.
7923;;Some methods include releasing sterile fire ant males, using insect growth regulators and natural enemies like the phorid fly.
7924;;For example, the phorid fly lays its eggs inside the body of a fire ant, causing the ant's death.
7925;;In another example, fire ants infected with a micro-organism from South America were released in Hope, Ark., and Durant, Okla., to reduce the fire ant numbers.
7926;;The pathogen T. solenopsae infects ant colonies and chronically weakens them.
7927;;Worker ants transmit the pathogen to the queen through food exchange.
7928;;The disease slowly reduced the queen's weight and she lays fewer eggs, all infected with the pathogen, further weakening the colony.
7929;;The imported fire ant quarantine provides for a coordinated, consistent approach to slowing the fire ant's spread.
793;;Riders do not necessarily need to see arrests take place, but merely having security presence heightens perceptions of safety.

7931;;THE RED IMPORTED FIRE ANT, SOlenopsis invicta Buren, introduced into the United States in the 1930s, has become a serious pest of man in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern United States (Lofgren et al. 1975, Adams 1986, Lofgren 1986).
7932;;This ant continues to spread and may establish populations in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
7933;;Baits have been used to control the fire ant since mirex was discovered in the early 1960s
7934;;New baits developed in the early to mid-1980s were based on a formulation similar to that of mirex bait; i.e., a chemical dissolved in once-refined soybean oil and applied to a corn grit carrier

8246;;The Cadet Program is designed to teach cadets leadership and give them an idea of the military customs and courtesies.
8247;;All cadets must learn drill and ceremonies in order to progress through the program.
8248;;Through the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, cadets have the opportunity to learn about aviation, travel to other parts of the world with the International Air Cadet Exchange program, attend flight academies, band encampments, leadership schools, and familiarization courses for the Air Education and Training Command and Air Force Space Command.
8249;;Those cadets who enjoy emergency services are able to attend special activities including Para-rescue Orientation Courses and Ground Search and Rescue Schools.
825;;Ponzi schemes are a type of pyramid scheme named for Charles Ponzi, who duped thousands of New England residents into investing in a postage stamp speculation scheme.
8250;;Civil Air Patrol provides Aerospace Education to both its seniors and its cadets.
8251;;Along with educating its own members about the importance of the aerospace field, the Civil Air Patrol also works to educate the general public about the importance of the field.
8252;;Civil Air Patrol holds workshops for teachers, assists in teaching about aerospace, and is the source of a great deal of information on the topic.
8253;;Civil Air Patrol takes part in Emergency Services as a way to help the Air Force free up valuable resources.
8254;;Civil Air Patrol participates in search and rescue, disaster relief, and in times of war, civil defense.
8255;;Civil Air Patrol squadrons have ground team qualified cadets and seniors that are available to take part in missions for both disaster relief and search and rescue missions.
8256;;To serve America by developing our Nation's youth; accomplishing local, state and national emergency and humanitarian missions; and educating our citizens on the impact of aviation and space."
8257;;Emergency Services (ES) may be CAP's best known of the three-faceted mission; itself having several components.
8258;;Since 1948, the Air Force controls the in-land search and rescue (SAR) activities within the United States.
8259;;CAP's role in this mission provides the bulk of the operational SAR services, primarily through flying and ground team activities.
826;;Ponzi determined that it was possible to take advantage of differences between U.S. and foreign currencies used to buy and sell international mail coupons.
8260;;In addition, CAP's ES activities also include performing civil defense activities and other missions, such as: crashed aircraft spotting and marking, route surveys, counterdrug reconnaissance, 19 courier services, light transport duty, post-attack recovery duty, and similar activities within the capabilities of CAP light aircraft and other equipment.
8261;;Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Programs provides young men and women, ages 12-20, with a safe and motivating environment in which to grow and explore opportunities in the military and aviation industries.
8262;;Internal Aerospace Education The internal program is concerned with two factors: (1) the Aerospace Education portion of CAP Cadet Programs, and (2) Aerospace Education activities for the senior members of Civil Air Patrol.
8263;;Within Cadet Programs, Aerospace Education is accomplished through self-study
8264;;and instructional sessions using the textbook, Aerospace: The Flight of Discovery and through
8265;;aerospace current events reports and activities during unit meetings.
8266;;CAP's Aerospace Education membership is an exclusive category for education professionals.
8267;;A professional Aerospace Education staff develops textbooks, lesson plans, and school
8268;;curriculum in support of its Aerospace Education members.
8269;;In addition, CAP hosts a number of

8271;;Education.
8272;;Since 1941, Civil Air Patrol has strived to save lives and alleviate human suffering through a myriad of emergency services missions ï¿½ Search and Rescue, Disaster Relief and Humanitarian Services.
8273;;CAP also carries out Counterdrug Operations and Drug Demand Reduction
8274;;programs under the auspices of its Emergency Services mission.
8275;;Perhaps best known for its search and rescue effort, CAP flies more than 85 percent of all inland search and rescue missions in the continental United States as tasked by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, based at Langley AFB, Va.
8276;;Civil Air Patrol volunteers are on call 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, to provide search and
8277;;rescue services to the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, the U.S. Coast Guard, rescue
8278;;coordination centers in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and state and local agencies.
8279;;Civil Air Patrol plays a vitally important role in disaster relief operations, providing air and ground transportation and an extensive communications network in times of disasters.

8285;;agencies.
8286;;CAP volunteers support flood-relief operations, monitoring water levels, stream flows and flooding projections.
8287;;Ground operations include sandbagging, dike patrol, managing emergency
8288;;shelters, and staffing disaster-relief hotlines.
8289;;CAP aircrews also provide real-time, slow-scan television images of flood-ravaged areas.

8292;;for the Department of Defense, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Customs Service, U.S.
8293;;Forest Service, and state and local law enforcement agencies.
8294;;CAP has been tasked to
8295;;provide rapid-response reconnaissance for the Southwest border.
8296;;In addition to its drug interdiction efforts, Civil Air Patrol is involved in an education program to encourage America's youth to remain drug free.
8297;;CAP's Drug Demand Reduction program provides alternatives to drug use through senior leadership, mentoring, training, alternative activities, and programs to prepare youth for success in life.
8298;;Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Programs provides young men and women, ages 12-20, with a safe and motivating environment in which to grow and explore opportunities in the military and aviation industries.
8299;;Special training is also conducted for those participating in search and rescue as mission pilots, observers or ground team members.

8304;;Civil Air Patrol, the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, is a non-profit, aviationoriented, civilian volunteer organization.
8305;;Our volunteers have three main purposes-- Emergency Services, Aerospace Education, and the Cadet Program.
8306;;Air Patrol is an aviation-oriented volunteer organization.
8307;;It is the Federally chartered auxiliary of the United States Air Force with three primary mission elements: ï¿½Emergency Services - search and rescue, disaster relief, counter narcotics, civil defense, etc..
8308;;ï¿½Aerospace Education to keep the membership and public informed on vital aerospace issues.
8309;;ï¿½Cadet Program designed to build character and inspire youth leadership through an interest in aviation.
831;;The pyramid scheme also is known as the Women's Empowerment Network, The Dinner Club, The Original Dinner Club and The Breakfast Club, but Nixon stressed the scheme is not limited to those names.
8310;;Working in close cooperation with the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), Civil Air Patrol performs 90% of all inland search and rescue activities throughout the nation.
8311;;The Aerospace Education Program teaches Cadets, Senior Members, and the general public about the importance of this nation's aerospace environment.
8312;;It also provides our Cadets and Senior Members an opportunity to learn about all aspects of flight, weather, navigation, aviation history, and many other flight-related subjects.
8313;;The Cadet Program develops and motivates you to become one of tomorrow's leaders and a responsible citizen.
8314;;The program teaches leadership skills, helps develop physical fitness, self-confidence, moral character, and the importance of teamwork.
8315;;Missions of Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Education Aerospace education represents CAP' effort to educate America s about the uses and benefits of the transportation, communications and military capabilities of the air and space.
8316;;We will accomplish this through our three missions: Cadet Programs Aerospace Education Emergency Services

8324;;After arriving in Iraq, Dooleyï¿½s unit was stationed at the Mosul Air Base.
8325;;According to Dooley, the company was immediately tasked with numerous missions as soon as it arrived in Mosul, Iraq.
8326;;He and other members of B-52 helped with road improvements and repairs.
8327;;Dooley described how he worked alongside Iraqi fire fighters for five days in July.
8328;;Dooley and other Oregon Guardmembers worked fourhour shifts battling a large sulfur fire, in 130-degree heat, all the while wearing protective masks.
8329;;Having met all of these challenges and more on the way to Mosul, the troops were ready for just about anything.
833;;In conjunction with the sweep, the FTC announced that it has filed suit in federal district court charging that Five Star Auto Club, Inc. and two of its principals lured Online consumers to invest in their pyramid scheme by claiming that an annual fee and $100 monthly payments would give consumers the opportunity to lease their "dream vehicle" for "free" while earning between $180 and $80,000 a month by recruiting others to join the scheme.
8330;;As work on the phase one house got underway, the soldiers quickly discovered that American methods are not always effective when working with Iraqi materials.
8331;;So, they took on some local workers to help make building the house somewhat easier.
8332;;These local workers taught the soldiers new ways of working with concrete blocks and mortar, while also providing them the unique opportunity to work hand-in-hand with Iraqis on a daily basis.
8333;;There were many more challenges to face as work continued on the first house, but the soldiers and their new Iraqi friends overcame all of them.
8334;;At the end of two months of work, the first house is complete.
8335;;This house is now being used to develop a training model for the former Iraqi soldiers that the platoon plans to train as well as to revise and refine the design for future houses.
8336;;This second phase consists of hiring a select group of former Iraqi soldiers to build another set of houses.
8337;;In phase two, the troops from the platoon that built the first house can apply what they learned there to teach the new hires, and it is already underway.
8338;;Phase three will begin in the near future, as the soldiers will step back from their responsibilities as trainers and turn primarily to inspection and quality control on the project.
8339;;Many of these same pilots and jets have also flown patrol missions in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch, both of which are NATO-based military campaigns used to provide aerial surveillance and defense of the no-fly zones in Iraq

8374;;We have our ups and downs like every unit who deploys.
8375;;Company A is in char ge of the airfieldï¿½s basecamp construction effort.
8376;;Over the past week, theyï¿½ve placed over 30 concrete foundations for what will eventually be wooden huts used for troop lodging.
8377;;Last Saturday, Company B had a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its newly renovated boysï¿½ and girlsï¿½ orphanages.
8378;;While they are waiting for the ribbon cutting at the first House of Hope, theyï¿½ve already started to build the foundation for the next iteration.
8379;;On another note, B-companyï¿½s earthmovers are still building roads in the Bardiyah area that will enable the locals to better travel from village to village.

8384;;The Seminole and Miccosukee people are descendants of Creek Indians who migrated from Georgia and Alabama to Spanish Florida in the early to mid-1700s.
8385;;The original Indian people of Florida including the Timucua,Calusa, Apalachee, and other Indian groups were either killed by disease or warfare, captured as slaves, or they left Florida with the Spaniards
8386;;The Second Seminole War, 1836--43, resulted from the efforts of the United States to remove the Seminole Indians from Florida.
8387;;The 1832 treaty of Payne's Landing had provided for a delegation of Indians to journey to the West and decide on the acceptability of the land set apart for them.
8388;;The Seminoles agreed to leave Florida for the West within 3 years of giving their approval.
8389;;The federal government ordered the Seminole Indians to gather on January 8, 1836, for removal---resistance would be met with force.
839;;Instead of educating just the slip holders, we went the extra mile and trained over 400 households in the practices necessary to meet the Maryland Clean Marina guidelines, Karsten said.
8390;;The ensuing clash plunged both sides into seven years of hardship.
8391;;Both free blacks and slaves fought with the Seminoles.
8392;;The U.S. Army enlisted volunteers and mercenaries from other tribes.
8393;;By 1843 the Army had forced all but a few hundred of the Indians to emigrate, in small groups, west of the Mississippi
8394;;Located in northwest Florida's Franklin County, approximately 15 miles from the mouth of the Apalachicola River, British Fort is a symbol of the strong relationship between runaway slaves and the Seminole Indians.
8395;;During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, slaves from the Carolinas and Georgia escaped to northern Florida, at that time under Spanish control, and sought and received refuge from the Seminole Indians.
8396;;In return, the runaway slaves would cultivate crops, paying one-third of their produce to the Indians.
8397;;In 1816, the American army, under the command of Major General Andrew Jackson, constructed Fort Scott on the Flint River a few miles from Florida to protect the American border between Georgia and Florida and to destroy Negro Fort, which was perceived as a threat to white slaveholders in Georgia.
8398;;In July of that year, Jackson gave the order to destroy Negro fort and to return the blacks to their white owners.
8399;;In the insuing warfare, an American shell hit an open magazine within the fort, killing approximately 300 men, women, and children.
84;;Over 200,000 wells have been drilled in Louisiana since 1901 and even more have been drilled in Texas.
840;;In addition, partners work to develop new programs, including the innovative Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which helps farmers protect sensitive streamside areas.
8400;;The few survivors were taken prisoner and turned over to Georgia slaveholders who justified their title to them by saying that their ancestors had owned the ancestors of the prisoners.
8401;;The Corps of Engineers and non-Federal sponsors shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, implement the Plan to ensure the protection of water quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the improvement of the environment of the South Florida Ecosystem and to achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the Plan, and required pursuant to section 601 of WRDA 2000 for as long as the project is authorized
8402;;Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida was originally part of the same group of Creek Indians as the Seminole Tribe who fought against the U.S. government during the Seminole Wars of the 1800s
8403;;Seminole Nation of Oklahoma In 1856, the U.S government established the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma in Indian Territory.
8404;;They are historically associated with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and represent the more than 3,000 Seminoles who were removed from Florida by the U.S government at the end of the Seminole Wars in the 1800s.
8405;;The conflict between the United States Army and Seminole bands began in 1814 when the First Seminole War exploded.
8406;;General Andrew Jackson illegally led troops into Spanish Florida to burn towns and capture freedom seekers.
8407;;However, with the passage of the 1830 Indian Removal Act, President Andrew Jackson sought to move all Native American groups east of the Mississippi River into Oklahoma and Arkansas.
8408;;The Seminole refused to leave Florida and by 1835 the Second Seminole War had erupted.
8409;;The remaining Seminole melted deeper into Florida lowlands, only to face the United States Army once again in 1855.
841;;CREP provides annual rental payments for 10 15 years and cost share for installing BMPS to conserve sensitive resource areas
8410;;This Third Seminole War lasted for three years until the Americans withdrew without result.
8411;;After defeating the U.S. in early battles of the Second Seminole War, Seminole leader Osceola was captured by the United States in Oct. 20, 1837, when U.S. troops said they wanted a truce to talk peace
8412;;In 1817, these conflicts escalated into the first of three wars against the United States.
8413;;Future U.S. President Andrew Jackson invaded then-Spanish Florida and defeated the Seminoles.
8414;;After passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, the U.S. government attempted to relocate Seminoles to Oklahoma, causing yet another war -- the Second Seminole War.
8415;;By May 8, 1858, when the United States declared an end to conflicts in the third war with the Seminoles, more than 3,000 of them had been moved west of the Mississippi River.
8416;;That left roughly 200 to 300 Seminoles remaining in Florida, hidden in the swamps
8417;;The Seminole Tribe of Florida currently employs more than 2,000 non-Indians and purchases more than $24 million dollars in goods and services from more than 850 Florida vendors a year.
8418;;In addition, the Tribe pays $3.5 million in federal payroll taxes.
8419;;Security companies, office supply stores, photocopying companies, insurance companies, banks, and maintenance companies in surrounding local communities provide goods and services to Seminole gaming facilities, as well as other tribal enterprises established with seed money from gaming revenues.
842;;Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) population health is determined by measuring the extent of areas with SAV growth each year.
8420;;In this respect, I support H.R. 190, a bill to amend the Act entitled ''An Act to provide for the establishment of the Everglades National Park in the State of Florida and for other purposes,'' approved May 30, 1934, to clarify certain rights of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.
8421;;This language clarifies 16 USC 410(b), part of the Everglades National Park Enabling Act of 1934, to protect the rights of the Miccosukees (as Seminoles who lived in the Park).
8422;;I believe that the language is reasonable and well-founded in that it fulfills original Congressional intent and codifies rights already recognized by the Department of the Interior in previously-issued ''special use permits.''
8423;;By using tactics unfamiliar to the white settlers and by hiding in the Everglades, Osceola and some of the Seminoles were successfully able to resist the United States government's attempts to remove them from Florida for a time.
8424;;It was not until the capture of Osceola and his death in 1838 at Fort Moultrie in South Carolina that the Seminoles were forced from their homeland
8425;;Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688) requires that the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the Interior, and consultation with the Seminole Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, promulgate programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
8426;;Following the Indian Wars, the Seminole blacks were forcibly moved with their Seminole allies to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
8427;;After suffering harsh treatment at the hands of the slave owners and oppression by the Creeks, groups of Seminoles, Seminole blacks, and other runaways began desperate migrations to Mexico, where slavery was not practiced.
8428;;Seminole black ties to Texas strengthened after the Civil War, accelerated by the return of their Seminole Indian allies back to Indian Territory.
8429;;In 1870, U.S. military officials, plagued by Indian raids on settlements and seeing value in their scouting and diplomatic skills with Indian tribes, persuaded the Seminole blacks to return to Texas.
843;;SAV coverage is assessed from aerial surveys and quantified by Chesapeake Bay Program segments using digital techniques.
8430;;In July of that year, a small group moved to Fort Duncan and two years later, another contingent of Seminole blacks moved to Fort Clark, becoming a unit and fighting their first military engagement.
8431;;Fort Clark became their home base through the early 1880s as the scouts performed exemplary duty in the Texas Indian campaigns of Bullis, Shafer, and other military leaders.
8432;;The War Department determined that Seminole black families would be removed from the fort and were entitled to no allotments since they were black and, despite their mixed blood, not considered Seminole.
8433;;Forced from their homes, some families returned to CRM No 2--1997 Nacimiento, Coahuila, while others traveled to Indian Territory in Oklahoma to settle among Seminole blacks who had not migrated south to Texas in 1849.
8434;;Yet, a few families, often destitute and dependent for handouts, remained in Brackettville until 1914 when the Seminole scouts were disbanded
8435;;Andrew Jackson On one of those military operations, in 1818, General Andrew Jackson made a foray into Florida.
8436;;Jacksons battles with Floridas Indian people later would be called the First Seminole War
8437;;Seminoles, already noted for their fighting abilities, won the respect of U.S. soldiers for their bravery, fortitude, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances during the Second Seminole War (183542).
8438;;This war, the most significant of the three conflicts between Indian people and U.S. troops in Florida, began over the question of whether Seminoles should be moved westward across the Mississippi River into what is now Oklahoma.
8439;;Under President Andrew Jackson, the U.S. government spent $20 million and the lives of many U.S. soldiers, Indian people, and U.S. citizens to force the removal of the Seminoles.
844;;These coverage estimates are compared to the SAV Restoration Goals to determine progress towards restoration of healthy SAV populations
8440;;In the end, the outcome was not as the federal government had planned.
8441;;Some Indians migrated "voluntarily."
8442;;Some were captured and sent west under military guard; and others escaped into the Everglades, where they made a life for themselves away from contact with whites
8443;;It was soon clear, however, that fighting between the Seminoles and white settlers had continued unabated, and the government was forced to intervene in order to protect American lives and property.
8444;;Negotiations in September 1823 resulted in the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, which established a four-million-acre reservation in the center of the Florida peninsula for the Seminole tribes.
8445;;The treaty also required the government to provide money and supplies during the move and to reimburse tribesmen for improvements on the land they were forced to abandon.41 The move to the reservation progressed slowly, but most tribes had relocated by 1826
8446;;In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the government to trade land west of the Mississippi River for Native American lands in the east and to assist in the removal of the tribes to their new homes.
8447;;In the Treaty of Payne's Landing (1832) and the Treaty of Fort Gibson (1833), Seminole leaders agreed to removal, but soon after they reneged and declared both agreements invalid.

8467;;In the late 1950s, a push among Indian tribes to organize themselves and draft their own charter began -- this came as a result of federal legislation which allowed Indian reservations to act as entities separate from the state governments in which they were located.
8468;;When the State of Florida threatened to close the bingo hall soon after it opened, we sued in federal court.

8589;;The goal of the Deformation Project is to reduce earthquake losses by improving knowledge of the time, place and size of future events.
859;;Designed for children ages 3 and up, the Bay Game helps increase awareness of how our surroundings relate to the Chesapeake Bay.
8590;;The Deformation Project investigates earthquake related deformation of the surface of the earth.
8591;;Tools used in these investigations include: the Global Positioning System (GPS), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), two-color laser ranging, dilatometric strain meters, magnetometers, tiltmeters, creepmeters and ground-water-level monitors.
8592;;The principal objective of the Southern California Integrated GPS Network [SCIGN] is to measure the displacement field associated with a mosaic of faults now thought to underlie the greater Los Angeles region.
8593;;However, without a quantitative measure of the anthropogenic deformation throughout the region, it will be difficult to properly assess the magnitude of human-induced signal vs. tectonic signal at any given SCIGN site.
8594;;Continuous GPS measurements in Northern California clearly show motion of Western North America relative to the more stable eastern two-thirds of the continent.
8595;;The eastern part of California (the Sierra-Nevada mountains and the Great Valley) are moving northwest relative to the eastern United States at a rate of about 10 mm/year.
8596;;This motion occurs continuously and steadily.
8597;;In 1996, the CVWD entered into a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to establish a geodetic network of monuments for monitoring land subsidence in the lower Coachella Valley.

8600;;At national, regional and urban scales, this upgrade should emphasize the collection of broadband and strong motion seismic data and geodetic (GPS) data within a coordinated, standardized system for data collection, analysis and distribution.
8601;;The system
8602;;should extend from ground motion, to telemetry, to processing,
8603;;archiving and distribution.
8604;;The revitalized system should serve the
8605;;needs of the seismological and engineering research communities,
8606;;and local and national reporting agencies.
8607;;Geotechnical and structural practice increasingly demand measurements of soil mass and structure deformations (for example, landslides, lateral spreading from earthquakes, long-period bridge response during earthquakes), so the benefits of GPS in complementing more conventional instrumentation technologies appear promising, particularly in remote monitoring applications.
8608;;The precise shape and time-dependent deformation of the Earth surface can be determined directly by space geodesy techniques, including Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and the Global Positioning System (GPS).
8609;;Obviously, the motions of the Earth's interior cannot be measured directly and must be deduced from the analysis of surface deformations combined with high-precision space-based measurements of the Earth's gravity and magnetic fields.
861;;The museum has also incorporated environmental policies into its boater's guide.
8610;;Improved understanding of the impacts of solid Earth processes on human activities and societies, particularly in relation to assessment and mitigation of vulnerability to natural hazards, is part of NASA's strategic goals.
8611;;Available observations of suitable accuracy extend over a few decades at most and cover only a very short period of the Earth history.
8612;;For this reason, the research strategy aims to sample key geophysical and geological phenomena over appropriate time and space scales (e. g., study of earthquake cycles in the Los Angeles Basin), develop data analysis schemes that allow interpolating between sparse observation sites and relatively short data records, and create models that can simulate the range of possible future events

8619;;In the past few years, many sites have been instrumented with permanent GPS receivers.
862;;In addition to educating boaters about how to minimize their environmental impacts, the museum has taken steps to mitigate against any potential pollution from their operations which includes developing an oil spill response plan and keeping oil spill response equipment on site.
8620;;These "Continuous" GPS sites are almost always equipped with telemetry that brings the data back to some central location for rapid processing.
8621;;There are a growing number of arrays of continuous GPS stations.
8622;;GPS is currently being used to monitor some structures.
8623;;As part of the USGS continuous GPS operations in Southern California, Pacoima Dam is being monitored through a joint pilot study in collaboration with Los Angeles County and other researchers within the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN).
8624;;The project was begun in order to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring dams and other engineered structures (such as freeway overpasses and high-rise buildings) using continuous GPS technology and infrastructure.
8625;;This dam is a 120 meter tall concrete arch that was constructed in the late 1920's.
8626;;Pacoima dam withstood, but was damaged by, very strong ground shaking in both the 1971 and 1994 earthquakes.
8627;;Due to concern about the stability of this dam in response to potential earthquakes in the future, the County purchased GPS equipment, and with assistance from the USGS in Pasadena, they began monitoring the dam using continuous GPS on September 1, 1995.

8632;;PANGA is an 18-station permanent GPS network installed in the Pacific Northwest with support of NSF and the Canadian Geological Survey in collaboration with the Central Washington University, University of Washington, and Oregon State University.
8633;;NSF supports separately a number of investigations utilizing the UNAVCO GPS equipment in crustal distortion areas that are prime candidates for future earthquakes.
8634;;Seismically active areas occupied to date within or near the U.S. include California, New England, the Caribbean, Colorado, Hawaii, Wyoming, and Montana.
8635;;Outside the U.S., important distortion areas in Turkey, Iceland, Greenland, Asia, and South America are being monitored
8636;;InSAR and GPS data were used to measure the effects of sub-surface, post-seismic relaxation processes after the Landers (1992) and Northridge (1994) earthquakes, allowing us to place constraints on the viscosity of the upper mantle in the Mojave domain
8637;;* Deployment of new experiments.
8638;;Establish a network of GPS tracking stations in the eastern Mediterranean.
8639;;Develop appropriate models to interpret the resulting information in terms plate motions and earthquake hazards.
864;;In addition to the national agenda for restoring and maintaining water quality, the federal government has given special recognition to the Chesapeake Bay as a natural resource of major significance (Section 117 of the CWA).
8640;;Strategic Importance: Extend GPS tracking to sparsely covered region Accurate determination of Africa-Arabia-Eurasia plate motions Constrain fault slip rates nd earthquake hazards throughout the eastern Mediterranean Anticipated Benefits: Provide improved GPS orbit in a strategically important area of the globe.

8645;;Modeling time-dependent interseismic, post-seismic and preseismic solid Earth deformation in the North American - Pacific interplate shear zone with comparison to continuous GPS time series.
8646;;Strategic Importance: * Deep crustal rheology and mantle viscosity accounted for in crustal motion models .
8647;;* Understanding of stress relaxation following large earthquakes.
8648;;* Explanation of continuous mode GPS data coupled with gravity data.
8649;;Develop techniques for geodetic study of seafloor motion using simultaneous GPS and acoustic ranging.
865;;Also, federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was established to protect the quality of drinking water in the US (42 USC 300f-300j-26).
8650;;GPS/acoustic methods have thus far been conducted campaign style, with annual visits.
8651;;Our project has developed techniques for continuous GPS/acoustic measurements using a moored buoy.
8652;;Strategic Importance: * Seafloor deformation is a significant natural hazard related to the production of earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis * The Big Island of Hawaii is particularly prone to these natural hazards and off-shore geodetic monitoring will compliment extensive on-shore monitoring in this region.
8653;;Estimate earthquake potential by mapping out creeping and locked portions of the Hayward fault at depth using InSAR and GPS data.

8661;;* Complete global understanding of plate tectonics.
8662;;* Deployment of new experiments.
8663;;Anticipated Benefits: Improved assessment of earthquake hazard using NASA developed GPS, InSAR, and computational techniques
8664;;We want to know how stations near active faults move relative to each other.
8665;;When we occupy several stations at the same time, and all stations observe the same satellites, the relative positions of all the stations can be determined very precisely.
8666;;Often we are able to determine the distances between stations, even over distances up to several 100 miles, to better than 5 millimeters
8667;;Months or years later we occupy the same stations again.
8668;;By determining how the stations have moved we calculate how much strain is accumulating and which faults are slipping.
8669;;Regional and National Network Operation Centers To ensure rapid and authoritative notification of potentially damaging earthquakes, national and regional seismic monitoring centers must have in place robust capabilities (hardware and software) for real-time data acquisition and processing and for the automated exchange of data and results.
867;;Limitations of Maryland's Involvement in the Chesapeake Bay Program to Reduce Nitrogen Pollution The primary limitation of the Maryland Office of the Chesapeake Bay Program is the lack of sufficient funds to carry out the existing nitrogen reduction programs to accomplish the present goals.
8670;;These tasks require modern, modular computer systems using common infrastructure (operating systems, communications protocols, and so on); robust applications software; and integration of all signals from ground-deformation sensors, including Global Positioning System (GPS).
8671;;Global Positioning System (GPS) technology with high sampling rates (~10 hz) allows scientifically justified and economically feasible dynamic measurements of relative displacements of long-period structures otherwise difficult ot measure directly by other means, such as the most commonly accelerometers that require post-processing including double integration.
8672;;We describe an experiment whereby the displacement responses of a simulated tall building are measured clearly and accurately in real-time.
8673;;Such measurements can be used to assess average drift ratios and changes in dynamic characteristics and therefore can be used by engineers and building owners or managers to assess the building performance during extreme motions caused by earthquakes and strong winds, by establishing threshold displacements or drift ratios and identifying changing dynamic characteristics.
8674;;Such information can then be used to secure public safety and/or take steps to improve the performance of the building
8675;;Ellipsoid height is the vertical coordinate relative to a geodetic reference system; the ellipsoid that closely approximates the Earth's shape in the study area is the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).
8676;;To determine changes in ellipsoid heights, heights from successive GPS surveys are compared, and the differences in the ellipsoid heights are used to determine the existence, location, and magnitude of vertical land-surface changes.
8677;;The response to the Kobe earthquake by the Japanese government involves the installation of thousands of new seismic stations, strong motion instruments, ocean bottom observatories, communication systems and GPS deformation sensors.
8678;;For example, the County of Los Angeles still periodically performs conventional surveys (as well as infrequent GPS surveys) at Pacoima Dam to obtain more spatially detailed information than the continuous GPS system provides.
8679;;Conventional surveys, however, require `line of sight' and do not lend themselves as well as does GPS to unattended, continuous field operations (utilizing high sampling rates and integrated network communications).
868;;Furthermore, significantly more funds will be needed in ten years to reduce nitrogen pollution beyond the current goals as even larger nitrogen loads are expected from a growing Bay population.
8680;;While data reduction is less complex for conventional surveying systems than for GPS, robust automation of highly precise GPS analysis is now reasonably routine.
8681;;Conventional surveying instruments are also limited in range and do not offer connection to an absolute reference frame, as does GPS.
8682;;Such limitations were realized following the 1971 San Fernando and 1994 Northridge earthquakes when many survey markers and access catwalks to them at the Pacoima dam site were destroyed by rockfalls and landslides.
8683;;This made it exceedingly difficult to assess how the dam might have moved with respect to surrounding bedrock.
8684;;The continuously operating GPS monitoring system described here will address this problem at Pacoima Dam following future damaging earthquakes
8685;;Continuous data recording from the GPS satellites, using ground-based receivers and robust telemetry, can be used for monitoring the health of engineered structures, and can thereby be useful for the public safety aspects of civil, structural, and earthquake engineering.
8686;;Because of their concerns about the stability of this dam, especially its response to potential future earthquakes, the County of Los Angeles, with the technical support of the USGS, began monitoring the dam using continuous GPS.
8687;;At Pacoima Dam, the station DAM1 was placed on the thrust block at the left (south) abutment of the dam, while station DAM2 was placed near the center of the dam's arch (Fig. 2).
8688;;The reference station CMP9 was placed on stable bedrock outside of the steep-walled canyon that the dam spans (Fig. 3).
8689;;At station CMP9, a bedrock knob was graded flat and a reinforced concrete slab was poured on the bedrock for use by LA County as a building foundation, then more recently as a heliport.
869;;Most recently a 200-foot wooden, collapsed bulkhead was replaced with rip rap; providing better habitat for aquatic species
8690;;The CMP9 GPS antenna was mounted into that slab and is covered by a hemispherical polycarbonate radome.
8691;;The current system at Pacoima Dam uses dual frequency P-code GPS receivers that are commercially available both in the USA and overseas.
8692;;These sample all civilian-accessible GPS observables at a rate of one sample every 30 seconds (although higher sampling rates, up to 2 Hz, are possible with this equipment).
8693;;Data are collected on the receivers' internal memory, then downloaded using high speed (19200-38400 baud) modems over regular phone lines once per day.
8694;;Once the files are retrieved by the USGS-SCIGN operations center, they are immediately moved over the internet to the permanent SCIGN data archive at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO).
8695;;This continuous GPS system at Pacoima Dam is part of SCIGN, and is based on the data retrieval and distribution system originally developed for the Permanent GPS Geodetic Array
8696;;In addition, in situ observing assets, such as GPS arrays, will be deployed as necessary for monitoring surface deformation over kilometer-scale baselines.
8697;;Installation of the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) will be completed in 2001 and the network will be evaluated over a period of the next five years.
8698;;Low-cost GPS arrays are currently being deployed at specific natural laboratories including some active volcanoes, tidal gauge sites in dynamic coastal environments, and other locations.
8699;;GPS array data will be combined with Interferometric SAR data and other geological and geomorphologic information to understand the basic mechanics of subsidence, volcanism, and shallow earthquake ruptures.
87;;As a public benefit of pearl farming, wild stocks of native black pearl oysters would increase over time in the general vicinity of a farm and eventually in the long term around the Islands
870;;At Chesapeake Harbour Marina in Annapolis, General Manager George Colligan asks his customers not to discharge their sewage treatment systems within the marina basin.
8700;;Scientists keep daily track of the horizontal and vertical position of each SCIGN station.
8701;;Plate motions usually cause the positions of the stations to change slowly and steadily over time, but the positions may change abruptly during earthquakes
8702;;First, we can potentially tell earthquake responders whether or not infrastructure systems have been tilted or strained.
8703;;This would allow them to take actions to avert damage that might otherwise indirectly result from an earthquake.
8704;;Those responsible for gravity driven infrastructure systems, such as water, oil, and waste-water lines, may realize the need to quickly know the deformation caused by an earthquake in order to respond appropriately.
8705;;Second, we can place instruments onto critical structures, and build GPS systems that directly monitor the displacement of engineered structures.
8706;;Such monitoring can be done with continuously operating GPS receivers, real-time telemetry of data, and rapid analysis of the data.
8707;;On November 3, 2002, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred along the Denali Fault in Alaska.
8708;;The geographic coordinates of the epicenter are 63.52oN and 212.47oE, at a depth of 5.0Km.
8709;;We have determined 3-dimensional displacements associated with this earthquake at several CORS located in Alaska (see Fig. 3).
871;;Under the guidance of Assistant Marina Manager Nancy Bray, both the marina and the boatyard have refined their pollution prevention measures.
8710;;We computed pre-earthquake positional coordinates for these CORS by using GPS data observed during the 5-day period immediately preceding the earthquake.
8711;;We also computed post-earthquake positional coordinates by using GPS data observed during the 5-day period that begins 9 days following the earthquake, hence our computed displacements may include some postseismic motion.
8712;;The Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) is a dense array of GPS stations in the Los Angeles Basin and surrounding region which continuously records the millimeter-scale deformation of the Earth's crust caused by tectonic motion.
8713;;The data collected are used by scientists to study mechanics of faults as well as to estimate seismic hazard in the region.
8714;;The outer layer of the earth is composed of a dozen or so large pieces called tectonic plates.
8715;;Most earthquakes result from distortion that occurs near the edges of these plates as they try to move past one another.
8716;;The Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites provide precise measurements of this movement and distortion and, thus, provide very direct information about what happens during earthquakes and very directly feed estimates of the probability of future earthquakes.
8717;;The Global Positioning System (GPS) was initially developed by the Department of Defense in order to provide location accuracies of a few meters.
8718;;However, the differential use of GPS with two or more receiving systems can achieve sub-centimeter accuracy and this fact has revolutionized the science of earthquake tectonics.
8719;;The distortion of the earths surface is an essential measure of the potential for earthquakes in a given region.
872;;For example, Ms. Bray developed new environmental policies for all marina customers and Mr. Hartge uses filter fabric to prevent particles dislodged by pressure washing from running into the creek
8720;;This distortion can be monitored with GPS and other space-based positioning systems.
8721;;NSF supports facilities that use GPS to monitor crustal distortion in both campaign and fixed-network modes.
8722;;The Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) is the most ambitious U.S. GPS fixed-network to date and is under construction with support of NSF in partnership with NASA, the USGS, and the Keck Foundation.
8723;;SCIGN, now almost one-half complete, will consist of 250 fixed GPS stations in southern California.
8724;;It will be linked with less dense networks in Nevada, northern California, and the Pacific Northwest.
8725;;The SCIGN data is available on the Internet in near-real time, and has already provided significant new discoveries and constraints on our ideas of the tectonics of the San Andreas Fault plate-boundary zone
8726;;The Global Positioning System (GPS) was initially developed by the Department of Defense in order to provide position accuracies of a few meters.

873;;The managers of Mears Po int Marina have developed comprehensive environmental management regulations.
8730;;NSF supports facilities that use GPS to monitor crustal distortion in both campaign and fixed-network modes.
8731;;The Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) is the most ambitious U.S. GPS fixed-network to date and is under construction with support of NSF in partnership with NASA, the USGS, and the Keck Foundation.

8734;;The SCIGN data is available on the Internet in near-real time, and has already provided significant new discoveries and constraints on our ideas of the tectonics of the San Andreas Fault plate-boundary zone
8735;;The NSF- and USGS-funded Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) has provided the impetus for the development of a large-scale permanent GPS geodetic array in southern California focused on earthquake hazard assessment - a new and ambitious concept for the use of GPS technology.
8736;;SCEC organized the southern California geodetic community through establishment of the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN).
8737;;SCIGN brings together networks and GPS expertise at UC San Diego, UCLA, MIT, USGS and JPL/NASA.
8738;;Funding is garnered from many sources, with an implementation plan developed by the SCIGN Steering Committee used to guide resource allocation.
8739;;The permanent array is now complete at 250 stations.
874;;These rules are incorporated into all contracts: slips rentals, transient dockage, dry land storage, and outside contractors.
8740;;Natural disaster damage assessment GPS systems help map and assess the aftermath of natural disasters, including floods, earthquakes and fires.
8741;;GPS is particularly useful when recognizable landmarks have been destroyed.
8742;;Earthquake monitoring and prediction High-accuracy GPS surveying receivers are being used to monitor the earth's crustal movements preceding earthquakes.
8743;;In Japan, a network of hundreds of GPS stations is monitoring shifts of a few millimeters in fault lines.
8744;;In the United States, GPS systems gather data for geology research projects related to land mass movement.
8745;;In both Southern California and Japan, large numbers of survey receivers are linked together in large networks to monitor crustal motion in an effort to provide earthquake warnings
8746;;The USGS uses GPS to measure crustal deformation all over the United States.
8747;;However most of the work is concentrated in the western states where most earthquakes occur and where rates of crustal deformation are high.
8748;;The principal tasks of the University of Utah-USGS cooperative agreement are to support seismic and GPS (global positioning system) station installation, maintenance, recording, and routine analyses of the Yellowstone Seismograph and GPS Networks (YSN).
8749;;The primary objectives of the YSN are to monitor and assess seismicity and ground deformation that may be related to both volcanic and tectonic earthquake activity.
875;;One rule is that all boat owners who live aboard their vessels are required to have a contract with a company that provides dockside sewage pumpouts.
8750;;Data from the YSN provide information for public safety, park and surrounding community management and planning, public information and interpretation, and for scientific research interests.
8751;;The YSN is designed to monitor earthquakes of the entire Yellowstone volcanic system, including Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and the nearby Hebgen lake fault zone.
8752;;The GPS stations provide continuous monitoring of the crustal deformation of the volcanically active Yellowstone caldera.
8753;;This project provides real-time earthquake surveillance by a recently upgraded 22-station, 32-component, seismic network telemetered via FAA microwave links (at no cost to the project) to Salt Lake City, Utah, and digitally recorded at the University of Utah Seismograph Stations.
8754;;The Global Seismographic Network (GSN): A network of broadband, digital seismic stations distributed globally to monitor earthquakes, underground nuclear explosions, volcanic activity, and to research deep earth structure.
8755;;The GSN has now reached the number of instruments required to provide uniform global coverage of the continents and part of the oceans.
8756;;Plans include station upgrades and replacements, enhancement of selected stations to `geophysical observatories,' with addition of GPS receivers, magnetometers, gravimeters, and microbarographs to form the nucleus of a multi-purpose geophysical network, continued improvements of telecommunication capabilities, and cooperation in the development of ocean bottom stations.
8757;;Satellite based geodetic technology has emerged (the Global Positioning System, or GPS) which makes it possible to detect with high precision the slow movement of the Earth's crust that can be used to monitor deformation in earthquake prone areas
8758;;Caltrans GPS Monitoring System Tracks Deformations During Full-Scale Earthquake Tests Caltrans research has demonstrated that movements of landslides and bridges could effectively be monitored remotely using Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and wireless technologies.
8759;;Extensive tests of RTKGPS verified centimeter-level accuracies, effective for tracking a wide range of dynamic motions.
876;;Although she does not sell fuel, Madelyn Reni, owner of Spring Cove Marina in Rock Hall, is prepared for a petroleum spill.
8760;;The deployment of a system for a full-scale earthquake test in Japan demonstrated the flexibility and stability of a pilot system, while providing an otherwise unattainable data set for earthquake researchers.
8761;;The principal NASA contribution is the measurement and interpretation of crustal deformation throughout the earthquake cycle (i. e., pre-seismic, seismic, and post-seismic periods) using space geodesy and remote sensing techniques, predominantly the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry.
8762;;The Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) is a network of 250 continuously operating Global Positioning System (GPS) stations completed in July 2001.
8763;;GPS is a constellation of navigation satellites that are used in conjunction with ground or airborne receivers to provide precise altitudes and horizontal positions.
8764;;Earthquake researchers have developed ways to use GPS to precisely measure the deformation of the Earth's crust, which can occur as slip on faults, as folding of rock layers, or as the slow elastic distortion of the ground.
8765;;The link between the motions of the plates that make up the Earth's crust and the resulting earthquakes is now being directly observed in southern California.
8766;;When a significant earthquake occurs, SCIGN measures the sudden release of the strain, and for larger earthquakes, SCIGN measures the deformation that occurs during the next few months.
8767;;The Global Positioning System (GPS) has matured as an important new technology for earthquake research.
8768;;It allows us to measure the deformation caused by an earthquake to within a few millimeters.
8769;;These data are then used, either alone or in conjunction with seismological and other data, to understand the source of an earthquake.
877;;In the event of an accidental spill, say from an onboard fuel leak that is pumped overboard by an automatic bilge pump, she has response equipment on site
8770;;Scientists have begun installing a network of 250 Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that will continuously measure the constant, yet physically imperceptible, movements of earthquake faults throughout Southern California.
8771;;This information, which in many cases will be gathered and analyzed with the help of local students, should help researchers forecast future earthquake hazards in the greater Los Angeles area.
8772;;"The surface of the Earth is constantly moving and Southern California is being squeezed in the process.
8773;;GPS in earthquake studies The Global Positioning System can be applied to scientific studies of earthquakes and faults.
8774;;The Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) is an example of how scientists are using GPS in order to study tectonic motion on a regional scale.
8775;;Using GPS to measure earthquakes
8776;;GPS (and more specifically SCIGN) does not measure the actual ground shaking during an earthquake, but rather the final displacement of the stations caused by the permanent deformation of the Earth's crust during an earthquake.
8777;;The bridge is closed.
8778;;Urgent phone calls are made.
8779;;Central Artery/Tunnel engineers and inspectors rush to the site.
878;;In 2001, the majority of Maryland farmers complied with the first of the nutrient management plan reporting deadlines stemming from the Water Quality Improvement Act.
8780;;The project team has spent upwards of three billion dollars worth of hours and effort to keep Boston open to traffic during construction.
8781;;The most expensive highway construction project in the world, the Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) in Boston, Massachusetts, is scheduled for completion in 2005.
8782;;Known as the Big Dig, the project includes a new tunnel under the harbor connecting Logan airport and interstate I-90, the Mass.
8783;;Turnpike.
8784;;I mention this to assure you that we are not looking for additional federal assistance to finish the Central/Artery Project.
8785;;The Legislature and Governor are currently devising a plan to finance the recently revealed Big Dig cost overrun, and none of those plans asks for any additional federal assistance.
8786;;This cost overrun is our problem in Massachusetts, and we will pay the bill for it.
8787;;Although the Big Dig is called a project, it's actually 90 different construction projects.
8788;;In many cases, contractors working on different projects work within inches of each other.
8789;;This degree of complexity creates an enormous potential for contract, schedule, and cost problems.
879;;As of December 31, 2001, Maryland farmers officially submitted nutrient management plan information for approximately 1.1 million acres of agricultural land, representing 65% of the agricultural land that is covered by the law.
8790;;Managers of the CA/T Project have chosen to deal with these issues through a partnering program designed to increase communication and help prevent conflict and misunderstanding.
8791;;The CA/T Project has not been without controversy, and it has caused some inconvenience for Boston's residents and visitors.
8792;;But the benefits of the completed project will be enormous.
8793;;An aging, unsightly elevated highway will be dismantled, opening up 11 hectares (27 acres) of land.
8794;;A daily traffic nightmare will be replaced by a normal urban rush hour.
8795;;Even air quality will be improved; carbon monoxide levels are expected to drop 12 percent citywide because traffic will be kept moving.
8796;;The project has been under construction since late 1991.
8797;;The cost of the Central Artery/Tunnel project is $10.8 billion through project completion in 2004.
8798;;The federal government will pay around 70 percent of the cost, and the commonwealth of Massachusetts will pay the remainder.
8799;;One-hundred and sixty-one lane miles of highway.
88;;Research is being carried out on the artificial culture of this pearl oyster's mantle (A. Machii, pers. comm.).
880;;In 2001, the Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program funded the development of a special video and informational outreach materials to promote the use of weed wiper technology and alternative management measures such as water control structures, pocket wetlands and other practices to retain vegetative buffers and slow the flow of water.
8800;;More than three million cubic yards of concrete.
8801;;Five miles of steel-reinforced concrete slurry tunnel walls.
8802;;And that's just for starters.
8803;;The Central Artery/Tunnel Project in Boston, Massachusetts, better known as the Big Dig, is one of the Nation's largest and most complex highway projects.
8804;;The 14-year endeavor, scheduled for completion in 2004, will replace an existing 6-lane elevated viaduct structure with a 10-lane underground expressway.
8805;;The one-count felony indictment charged Jean Pierre Cagnat, the former chief executive officer of Freyssinet, with conspiring to rig bids in violation of the Sherman Act from September 1996 until December 1997.
8806;;The indictment charges that in carrying out the conspiracy, Cagnat and co-conspirators met in London, England and agreed to participate in a bid rotation scheme.
8807;;They carried out the conspiracy by exchanging price information for upcoming stay cable system bids, and submitting noncompetitive, rigged bids on the projects.
8808;;The unprecedented cost, scope, and complexity of the CA/T Project made it necessary to dedicate additional resources to enforcement and oversight activities, and brought about the creation of the Commission.
8809;;In 1995, the Legislature enacted Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 (the Metropolitan Highway Bill), which directed the State Auditor, the Inspector General, and the House and Senate Committees on Post Audit and Oversight to jointly prepare a comprehensive plan for oversight on the CA/T Project.
881;;In 2001, Marylanders created over 264 miles of forest buffers along waterways under the leadership of DNR, a rate over twice the annual goal.
8810;;Massachusetts Highway Department will provide funding to contractors to purchase the emission control devices.
8811;;The devices cost approximately $2,000 for oxidation catalysts and $9,000 for particulate filters
8812;;The Office informed MassHighway that MassHighway's procurement of a $231,526 fireboat for the city of Boston violated the state's procurement statute, that MassHighway had paid $100,000 more than the actual cost of the fireboat to the contractor, and that because the FHWA had declined to participate in funding the fireboat, the full cost was borne by Massachusetts taxpayers.
8813;;The B/BP's Responsibility for Cost Overruns Globe Finding: The Project ran up "1.6 billion in construction cost overruns," of which at least $1.1 billion was tied to B/PB errors.
8814;;B/PB Reply: The Globe contends that cost overruns totaling $1.1 billion are B/PB's fault and responsibility.
8815;;As explained in the section entitled "B/PB's Responsibility for Cost Overruns," the Inspector General's Office concludes that in many cases, the categorization of cost overruns as "differing site conditions" has been used by B/PB as a cover story for its failure to perform its contractually obligated duties to assess site conditions during the design stage.
8816;;This report was highly critical of the Turnpike Authority's failure to pursue cost recovery against B/PB and reported that the cost recovery program had only collected $30,000 from more than $80 million in claims.
8817;;The Office informed MassHighway that MassHighway's procurement of a $231,526 fireboat for the city of Boston violated the state's procurement statute, that MassHighway had paid $100,000 more than the actual cost of the fireboat to the contractor, and that because the FHWA had declined to participate in funding the fireboat, the full cost was borne by Massachusetts taxpayers.
8818;;In December 2000, the Inspector General issued a detailed report entitled A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Cost Recovery Program.
8819;;The review disclosed that in six years, the Project had only recovered $30,000 from about $83.5 million in cost recovery related change orders
882;;Currently, the total accomplishment is 595.7 miles.
8820;;The Integrated Project Control System operations control center is located in a new $20 million building at the entrance to the Ted Williams Tunnel.
8821;;Features of the the 40-foot by 60-foot control room include: Two rows of five operator positions each Video wall display with eighteen 90-inch diagonal rear projection units plus 54, 21-inch video monitors.
8822;;Each operator has a dual, 19-inch monitor, single workstation and six 13-inch video monitors A backup operations control center with four operator positions and 70 monitors is located nearby.
8823;;Among the key points in this report are the following: 5 The difference between the current $14.1 billion estimate and the former estimate of $10.8 billion is $3.3 billion.
8824;;The Project has reported an overrun of $2.5 billion.
8825;;The difference between the $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion is explained by the reversal of the almost $900 million insurance offset credit that had been used to maintain the $10.8 billion estimate since 1997
8826;;Documents cite a directive from Big Dig officials telling B/PB to "hit the target" of 5 $7.98 billion.
8827;;To hit the target, state, B/PB, and local FHWA officials began an extensive cost reduction initiative that consisted of the following: x Reducing every B/PB "to-go" contract estimate across the board - including material, labor and overhead - by a 13 percent "market discount" despite the recommendation of B/PB officials by letter from the home office in San Francisco not to do so.
8828;;8 x Reducing the post-contract award Potential Change Allowance (PCA) from 26 percent to seven percent - a 19 percent discount for every to-go estimate.
8829;;B/PB refused to reduce the PCA estimate until Big Dig officials asked for permission from local FHWA officials to use the lower estimate and for B/PB to stop tracking PCA percentages.
883;;This accomplishment brings us very close to the Governor's goal of 600 miles by 2010, and is a bulwark of our efforts to red uce nutrient pollution and restore habitat in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
8830;;x Reducing every to-go contract estimate by eliminating the 18 percent contingency allowance for construction growth during design.
8831;;x Excluding all management costs from the estimate after the year 2002.
8832;;x Excluding eminent domain costs (right-of-way) above the initial state payment (or pro tanto9). x Excluding more than $1 billion in costs defined as "non-Project costs."
8833;;x Stating all estimates in 1994 dollars and excluded to-go escalation (inflation costs) from the total cost.
8834;;Later, they insisted that the budget exclude all escalation since 1988.
8835;;x Applying a myriad of other deductions and assumptions to the official cost estimate.
8836;;Cumulatively, these deductions had the effect of reducing the final cost estimate by approximately $6 billion dollars, from $13.8 billion to $8 billion.
8837;;As a result of their 1995 review, local FHWA officials directed Big Dig officials to add back: approximately $1 billion in exclusions to the CSU-Rev.6 estimate; $315 million in future escalation; $255 million for an air rights credit; 11 $90 million as a 10 percent design contingency; and to raise the change order estimate from seven percent to 10 percent.
8838;;These add-backs raised the estimate from $8 billion to $10.4 billion.
8839;;By 1999, for example, Big Dig officials had disclosed $1 billion in actual overruns and $750 million in likely over-runs.
884;;The Critical Areas Program applies to tidal lands and waters of the Chesapeake Bay to the head of tide and all lands within 1000 feet of Mean High Water or from the landward ed ge of tidal wetlands.
8840;;"Project costs are stable at $10.8 billion."
8841;;Privately, Big Dig officials identified $1.3 billion in current overruns.
8842;;In desperation, these officials included offsets in the up-down charts that federal authorities had previously disallowed.
8843;;22 December 1999 Big Dig officials held meetings deliberating whether to publicly disclose the overrun.
8844;;Between 1992 and 2005, some $35 billion in state funds will be expended on these and other statewide infrastructure projects including the construction of new schools, libraries, and repairs to roads and bridges.
8845;;Of that $35 billion, some $4 billion in state funds will have gone to the Big Dig, little more than 10 percent.
8846;;How do we propose to pay for the project's cost overrun? Gov. Cellucci and Lt. Governor Swift have instructed me to follow four principles in designing the state bailout plan: No tax increase No damage to the state's credit rating Build a contingency reserve fund to handle any future shortfall No proposals that mobilize interest group opposition A final finance plan should be forthcoming in the next two weeks, drawn from common elements in separate plans proposed by the Massachusetts House, Senate and Governor.
8847;;Two-thirds of the administration plan is contained in both the House and Senate plans, so there is a great deal of common ground and we are confident a viable plan will be in place.
8848;;This plan will cover the $1.4 billion cost overrun and also create a sizable contingency reserve to be used to offset future possible overruns or other transportation needs in the Commonwealth.
8849;;"Happily, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is helping to pay the cost of the Big Dig, but I have to believe that if Congress had looked at the real cost of the project, Boston would have been told instead to restore its current bridges over the Boston Harbor at less than 1/10th of the cost," Petri said
885;;On a watershed scale, the implementation of these urban programs continues to promote environmentally sensitive site design, increase economic feasibility of low impact development, and contribute to the integrated approach of waters hed protection.
8850;;It is my hope this hearing will enable us to explore the complete and utter failure of the parties involved in this immense, multi-billion dollar transportation project, including Federal and State officials and project managers.
8851;;Federal taxpayers are paying 85 percent of the cost of Boston, Massachusetts' Central Artery project, also known as "The Big Dig."
8852;;The Big Dig requires major disruptions during construction.
8853;;My latest case in point: Big Dig engineers have spent more than $400 million over the last decade to relocate electric, gas, water and telecommunications lines from the path of the underground expressway, its ramps and interchanges.
8854;;The sprawling web of underground pipes, electric and telephone lines, some of them decades old, are being replaced with vastly improved, modern lines: fiber-optic telephone lines, $44 million to replace a Boston Edison electric substation built in 1915, new and improved sewage lines.
8855;;And, as John P. Sullivan Jr., chief engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission put it -- quote --: "You now have this golden opportunity to make improvements, and to date, we haven't put in a penny."

8857;;JUNE 26, 2002 - The OSA reported that more than $1 million in unused funds from a Force Account DMB09 was available for use to the CA/T Project.

886;;Maryland's Shore Erosion Control Program was established in 1968 within DNR for the purpose of addressing shoreline and streambank erosion problems along the Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay and their tributaries.
8860;;SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 - The Big Dig Project should use $58 million in excess insurance premium payments to cut costs instead of holding onto funds until the year 2017 as currently planned.
8861;;The audit reports that this $58 million should be made immediately available to help defray the substantial funding shortfall currently facing the project.
8862;;This would also produce the added benefit of reducing project-related debt-servicing costs by approximately $21 million.

8864;;The Big Dig requires major disruptions during construction.
8865;;So, Petri explained, in order to keep everybody happy and quiet, the administrators of the project have been spreading money around to all sorts of local government agencies, businesses, and educational institutions.
8866;;"Consider one example: The Boston Fire Department wanted a fire boat.
8867;;And after the purchase was made, the boat had to be redesigned because firefighters with their equipment on, couldn't get into the cabin.
8868;;And the fuel tanks were exposed -- meaning that the whole thing could blow up if the fire boat got near a fire," Petri said
8869;;The report addressed issues related to the $1.4 billion Big Dig cost overrun announced in February 2000.
887;;The Program provides assistance to Maryland property owners in resolving shoreline and streambank erosion problems.
8870;;The announcement of this overrun followed a December 1999 bond issuance and was prior to a February 2000 bond issuance.
8871;;By October 2000, Big Dig officials announced that the overrun had increased to $2.5 billion.
8872;;The OIG examined the history of this overrun and found that it resulted from budget assumptions made in 1994 and 1995 that were accepted by federal officials.
8873;;During the pre-sale period for those bonds, the Turnpike Authoritys outside counsel acknowledged to CA/T Project officials, but not publicly, that the Big Dig faced an almost $1.4 billion overrun.
8874;;In 1994, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB), the states management consultant responsible for administering the Big Dig, provided the Governor and state officials with a Big Dig cost estimate of almost $14 billion, a figure uncannily close to the June 2000 current $14.1 billion estimate.
8875;;B/PBs $14 billion estimate in 1994 starkly contradicted the $8 billion estimate (more exactly $7.998 billion) offered publicly by Big Dig officials28 at that time.
8876;;After B/PB presented its $14 billion estimate in 1994, state managers directed state and B/PB staff to undertake a cooperative effort to maintain the fiction of an on-time and on-budget $8 billion project.
8877;;Records showed that they did so by applying a largely semantic series of exclusions, deductions, and accounting assumptions that covered-up the $6 billion difference.
8878;;For example, the OIG warned that access restraints for construction contractors could create delay claims that would increase CA/T Project costs.
8879;;A review of these contracts identified $8.7 million in access delay related cost increases.
888;;Since 1968, Shore Erosion Control has assisted numerous property owners and established more than 800 structural projects and 325 non- structural projects.
8880;;Through a sample of the change orders that created the $125 million worth of construction contract cost increases, the OIG identified more than $24.8 million in cost increases (nearly 20 percent of the total $125 million increase) that relate directly to specific issues raised by the OIG in previous reviews or reports.
8881;;The OIG also identified $3.5 million in design contract cost increases during construction.
8882;;This brings the total cost increase for the contracts the OIG reviewed to almost $130 million.
8883;;As of December 2003, the combined cost of the 13 contracts had increased by more than $125 million -- nearly 40 percent.
8884;;Total construction costs for the 13 contracts reviewed by the OIG increased by nearly $125 million, or 40 percent.
8885;;The OIG has continually expressed concern to the CA/T Project regarding contract cost growth during construction.
8886;;The OIG informed the CA/T Project on many occasions that work paid for through change orders is invariably more expensive than work paid for after a competitive procurement process.
8887;;Under its contract with the Commonwealth, B/PB is responsible for design and contract management including the review and negotiation of change orders.
8888;;The more than $125 million identified by the OIG to date, could have been greatly reduced if B/PB had accepted the OIG's advice and made the necessary changes in the original construction contract bid package.
8889;;These contract changes might have avoided change orders that led to the large cost increases
889;;The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative promotes and celGlenda Felmey, manager of Londontowne Marina in Edgewater, ebrates the voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution is using some assistance from mother nature to help solve a stinky from marinas and recreational boats.
8890;;According to CA/T Project documents, the cost of the C01B1 contract has increased by nearly $8 million.
8891;;Of this increase, $4.7 million or nearly 60 percent of the increase for access restraints and milestone revisions.
8892;;B/PB is responsible for the "the proper The potential for delay development of access restraints and interim milestones."
8893;;should have been evident and therefore been better managed by B/PB.
8894;;b) In the August 1999 review of the C09A3 contract, the OIG reiterated from the C01B1 review, concerns about contractor access restraints.
8895;;Again the CA/T Project stated that they recognized the issues and had dealt with them in "all contracts."
8896;;The cost of the C09A3 contract has increased by $8 million.
8897;;Of this increase, $4 million or 50 percent of the increase is for access delays.
8898;;B/PB is responsible for "the proper development of access restraints and interim milestones" Commonwealth.
8899;;In addition to these large increases, C09A3 witnessed small increases as that might have been avoided.
89;;Also, some studies have been conducted on its chromosomes in spite of technical problems caused by the presence of so much yolky material in the eggs (K. Wada, see footnote 3).
890;;It was developed in response problem: the disposal of fish scraps.
8900;;For example, one small increase of nearly $10,000 dealt with meeting the requirements of state elevator inspectors.
8901;;Between 1993 and 1999 the cost estimate increased from according to its management contract with the 4 $5 million to $10 million.
8902;;Responding, in part, to the OIG's concerns, the CA/T Project initiated a cost savings re-design effort for the toll plaza.
8903;;As a result, the CA/T Project lowered the pre-bid construction contract cost estimate to $7.5 million.
8904;;The CA/T Project awarded the contract to the low bidder at $7.3 million.
8905;;However, six months after construction began, the CA/T Project issued the first of a multi-part change order that would grow to more than $2 million for design changes and revisions to the toll plaza.
8906;;The MTA required most of the changes because of a need to "conform to current technological developments."
8907;;The current cost of the contract is nearly $18 million, an increase of $11 million or 147 percent.
8908;;B/PB should have ensured adequate toll plaza design without the incumbent redesign costs.
8909;;In addition, the toll plaza contract increased by $4.6 million because of a scope transfer.
891;;She composts the scraps to to federal legislation passed in 1990 that requires states to address produce high quality fertilizer for her own landscaping needs.
8910;;A scope transfer is the movement of work from one contract to another.
8911;;This type of transfer provides the contractor with added work that is usually paid at a rate higher than if the work had been bid.
8912;;In this case, the CA/T Project added $4.6 million in work during construction and paid a premium for this decision.
8913;;B/PB's decision to transfer scope from one contract to another may have increased overall CA/T Project costs for the 5 Commonwealth.
8914;;Design costs increased by nearly $3.5 million during construction of four contracts previously reviewed by the OIG.7 the Additional construction phase services (work performed by designers during construction) and design changes after the award of the construction contracts caused a $3.5 million increase in design contract costs.
8915;;There might have been additional design contract increases that the OIG could not identify because of the way the CA/T Project and the designers track and account for these changes.
8916;;For example, the D015A design contract generated at least three construction packages (C15A1, C15A2, and C15A3).
8917;;The OIG reviewed the C15A3 contract.
8918;;A change to the D015A contract might not specify work related either whole or in part to the C15A3 contract.
8919;;The D015A 6 contract had at least $30 million in change orders for work performed by the designer during construction.
892;;When the pumpout system at Magothy Marina broke this past summer, manager and president Victoria Shiroky gave her customers coupons for a free pumpout at a later date and directed them to the next closest pumpout.
8920;;Apart from the $3.5 million directly relating to construction phase services for the C15A3 contract, it remains unclear how much of the $30 million is related to the C15A3 contract versus the C15A1 and C15A2 contracts.
8921;;A number of the OIG's reviews warned specifically of the potential for costly design and other changes during construction.
8922;;The OIG's March 2001 report, A History of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finance 1994-2001, identified how B/PB intentionally assisted in the underreporting of what has amounted to billions of dollars of CA/T Project costs.
8923;;Interestingly, of these billions, $118 million8 pertained to design construction phase services.
8924;;Arguably, B/PB's underreporting of these design costs, including the $3.5 million identified in this report, led to 7 8 The contracts are C01B1, C07C1, C15A3, and C17A3.
8925;;For the 13 contracts previously reviewed by the OIG, costs have increased by $125 million or 40 percent.
8926;;Much of the construction cost increases is attributable to B/PB mismanagement.
8927;;Happily, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is helping to pay the cost of the Big Dig, but I have to believe that if Congress had looked at the real cost of the project, Boston would have been told instead to restore its current bridges over the Boston Harbor at less than 1/10th of the cost.
8928;;So, for choosing the most expensive option for getting cars across the Boston Harbor, the Congress of the early 1980s is the proud winner of my latest coveted Porker Award
8929;;Our mission was to investigate the potential $1.4 billion cost overrun of the "Big Dig" project, to evaluate the state's plan for addressing the overrun costs, and to examine the overall management and oversight processes.
893;;The coupons helped to alleviate some of the frustration felt by boaters with full holding tanks.
8930;;To complete its mission, the Federal Task Force: * assessed the FHWA oversight process and reviewed the FHWA management structure; * determined the effectiveness of the project's financial reporting system; * investigated the $1.4 billion potential cost overrun and examined the state's plan to cover the overrun; * assessed potential indicators for better predicting costs increases; and * assessed potential cost saving measures.

8933;;The Inspector General issued a detailed report that provided additional evidence of deficient work on the part of B/PB in connection with $65 million in Project cost increases relating to ground movement, or "grout heave."
8934;;The Office has also identified more than $340 million in contract modifications resulting from "differing site conditions."
8935;;However, the Office has identified cases in which the attribution of cost overruns to "differing site conditions" has been used by B/PB as a cover story for its failure to perform its contractual obligation to fully assess site conditions during the design stage
8936;;In addition to the $1.07 billion in cost overruns, the Project also incurred many millions of dollars more in administrative costs associated with these overruns.
8937;;This $1.07 billion figure represents a major portion of the universe of potential cost recovery claims that will become the subject of the major cost recovery initiative underway at the Turnpike Authority
8938;;B/PB neglected to perform basic work called for in its contracts, such as conducting crucial field surveys of the elevated Artery.
8939;;As a result, contractors incurred large overruns.
894;;Also, the coupons encouraged boaters to continue to properly dispose of their sewage
8940;;Such failures cost the state more than $350 million.
8941;;B/PB Reply: The $350 million reflects costs to deal with what engineers call "differing site conditions" -- unexpected obstacles to construction, such as undocumented utilities.
8942;;Flawed Contract Globe Finding: The state's contract was fundamentally flawed, effectively rewarding the firm for delays and overruns.
8943;;B/PB Reply: B/PB has received a standard compensation package for the professional services it provides.
8944;;This includes fees for service as well as reimbursement of its labor and operating costs, a normal industry practice.
8945;;It has always had project incentives to minimize delays, overruns, or both.
8946;;Inspector General's Response: B/PB does not address the Globe's underlying conclusion that B/PB's compensation indirectly increases in proportion to Project length and cost.
8947;;The Inspector General's Office independently reached this conclusion as well.
8948;;In May 2000, this Office wrote that under its contract, B/PB is paid principally on a costplus-fixed-fee basis, which fails to create the necessary incentives or to hold B/PB accountable for meeting CA/T Project budget and schedule goals.

8951;;The system features a high density of field equipment, and double or triple redundancy in many elements.
8952;;Controversy has added to the challenge.
8953;;Project management and cost increases have made the Big Dig, at more than $14 billion, the most expensive interstate project ever.
8954;;Experience on the CA/T and other projects prompted DOT to establish a task force on oversight of large transportation infrastructure projects.
8955;;U.S. Representative John W. Olver (D-1st District) announced today that the US Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, has approved a new official Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) action plan to deal with the escalating concerns of the Big Dig.
8956;;Among the most important items is the Department of Transportations commitment to protecting statewide funding for the local bridge and road program.
8957;;In 1989, the Project management estimated that construction would be completed in 1998 at a cost of $4.4 billion.
8958;;In March 1997, the Project management estimated that construction would be completed in 2004 at a cost of more than $10.8 billion, six years later and 145% more expensive than the 1989 estimate.
8959;;The United States General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in its July 1997 review of the CA/T Project, and confirmed in its February 1998 report, that the cost of the CA/T Project will likely exceed the current MassHighway estimate of $10.8 billion and could reach as high as $11.6 billion.
896;;Another option is to capture maintenance debris with vacuum sanders.
8960;;The $10.8 billion cost estimate includes a credit to the cost of the CA/T Project of about $800 million, which represents the future receipts of insurance proceeds.
8961;;The GAO also concluded that MassHighway's $10.8 billion cost estimate was based on aggressive cost containment goals, which would be difficult to achieve based on past performance.
8962;;The GAO estimated that the cost of completing the CA/T Project could increase between an additional $100 million and $500 million, if these goals were not achieved.
8963;;The GAO also reported that MassHighway's December 1996 feasibility study reflected a significant shortfall of between $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion in project funding, depending upon the federal funds provided.
8964;;To finance the shortfall, the Commonwealth intends to borrow approximately $2.1 billion through the issuance of Bond and Grant Anticipation Notes.
8965;;These notes will be repaid after federal and other funds are received
8966;;Petri explained that Federal taxpayers are paying 85 percent of the cost of the project, also known as "The Big Dig."
8967;;At a projected cost of $11.6 billion to build two highway tunnels, the Big Dig is the most expensive highway project in the nation's history.
8968;;His latest case in point: Big Dig engineers have spent more than $400 million over the last decade to relocate electric, gas, water and telecommunications lines from the path of the underground expressway, its ramps and interchanges.
8969;;But they haven't simply relocated the lines.
897;;To minimize the chance of a fuel spill at Coltons Point Marina, the owners have installed double -walled aboveground fuel tanks equipped with emergency shut-off valves at the tanks, fuel dock, and in the office.

8972;;"Now underway," Petri continued, " Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project is, as the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority notes, the largest, most complex and technologically challenging highway project ever attempted in American history."
8973;;The project has gone through a series of scandals and budget adjustments, Petri explained.
8974;;Earlier this month, the Chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority revealed that the latest cost overruns have raised the price of the Big Dig by $1.4 billion, boosting it to a current estimated cost of $12.2 billion.
8975;;In real dollar terms, this makes the Big Dig more costly than the building of the Panama Canal and the Alaska Pipeline.
8976;;Today's hearing is designed to take a careful and in-depth look into the Boston Central Artery/Tunnel project -- the biggest, most costly public works project in U.S. history -- and commonly referred to as "the Big Dig."
8977;;This project has suffered from gross mismanagement and what appears to have been a complete lack of critical federal oversight.
8978;;As such, it has experienced billions of dollars in cost overruns.
8979;;The Central/Artery Tunnel project was originally estimated to cost $2.5 billion in 1985.
898;;To prevent even small spills, manager Clark Lutz Pam Sisson, Fishing Creek keeps a specially-designed plastic jug Landings Marina, (top) and at the fuel dock to catch overflows from Coltons Point Marina vessel vent fittings.

9014;;SEPTEMBER 13, 1995 - The OSA found that $3 million was wasted when the Massachusetts Highway Department and its management consultant failed to provide adequate oversight over certain design activities associated with the Third Harbor Tunnel tubes.
9015;;Specifically, a welding design problem exposed the project to potentially dangerous safety conditions, and added $625,688 in additional costs; a shortfall in over seven feet of tunnel tube length added $504,650 in additional costs to the project; and inadequate controls over a cancelled design change involving a tunnel tube hatch closure created a potentially dangerous situation.
9016;;Additionally, a defective tunnel section would not anchor to the harbor floor, causing contractors to weight the section down with heavy machinery, or be faced with the section floating away with the next incoming tide.
9017;;Further, money was needlessly spent due to the project's inability to complete a land taking deal on time.

9031;;Congress' General Accounting Office now estimates that the 'Big Dig' (as it's called) will cost an estimated $11.6 billion to complete, 85 percent of which comes from federal taxpayers," Petri said.
9032;;So project administrators had a contractor go out and buy a glorified dinghy at a cost of $230,000.

9037;;Congress' General Accounting Office now estimates that the "Big Dig" -- as it's called -- will now cost not $10 billion, but an estimated $11.6 billion to complete, 85 percent of which comes from federal taxpayers.
9038;;The fact is, the Big Dig requires major disruptions during construction.
9039;;So, in order to keep everybody happy and quiet, the administrators of the project have been spreading money around to all sorts of local government agencies, local businesses, and local educational institutions.

9042;;The state Inspector General says that was $100,000 too much, partly because the contractor took a $70,000 commission.
9043;;And there's more: After the purchase was made, the boat had to be redesigned because firefighters with their equipment on, couldn't get into the cabin.
9044;;And the fuel tanks were exposed -- meaning that the whole thing could blow up if the fire boat got near a fire.
9045;;Failure to Resolve a Project Design Issue in a Timely Manner Resulted in Increased Project Costs of $4.5 Million: Although CA/T Project management became aware of cost increases due to a design issue with the NSRL, this issue was not resolved until approximately 20 months later.
9046;;As a result, the CA/T Project incurred approximately $4.5 million in unnecessary design and construction costs.
9047;;Improper Utilization of $6.9 Million in State Highway Funding for Non-Highway Purposes: The CA/T Project used approximately $6.9 million in state highway funds for preliminary design and construction of the NSRL, which is a non-highway project and failed to obtain reimbursement of these costs from the parties that benefited.
9048;;Now underway, Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project is, as the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority notes, the largest, most complex and technologically challenging highway project ever attempted in American history.
9049;;The project has gone through a series of scandals and budget adjustments.
905;;The tip cards describe simple things boaters can do to protect our natural resources.
9050;;Most recently, earlier this month, the Chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority revealed that the latest cost overruns have raised the price of the Big Dig by $1.4 billion, boosting it to a current estimated cost of $12.2 billion.
9051;;In real dollar terms, this makes the Big Dig more costly than the building of the Panama Canal and the Alaska Pipeline.
9052;;Originally, the "Big Dig," as it's sometimes called, was supposed to cost $2.5 billion.
9053;;But the latest estimate is $10 billion -- with 85 percent coming from the federal taxpayer, Petri said.
9054;;"What's more, one third of the cost has little or nothing to do with the roadway itself.
9055;;Billions are being spent to mollify local business and community groups.
9056;;Take one example: The old Boston Garden -- the local sports arena -- got $15 million because the Big Dig took away storage space where the Boston Celtics had kept their famous parquet floor and other equipment.
9057;;$15 million -- even though appraisers said they could have replaced the storage space for $3 million," he said, adding, "At least I can finally report that Congress is in the process of turning off the money spigot, and turning remaining costs over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

9061;;$85 million in approved costs to deal with third parties, such as utilities and property owners adjacent to the project.
9062;;$460 million in unclassified costs.
9063;;Inspector General's Response: The Inspector General's Office strongly concurs with the Globe conclusion that $1.1 billion in cost overruns are linked to contracts begun before designs were completed and contracts with cost overruns related to differing site conditions.
9064;;Our review concludes that more than $730 million in contract modifications were associated with construction contracts initiated prior to final design approval.
9065;;Our review also found that more than $340 million in contract modifications resulted from 5 contracts that involved differing site conditions.
9066;;In total, this represents more than $1.07 billion in cost overruns associated with contracts that were either initiated prior to final design or were later modified due to differing site conditions.
9067;;The Inspector General concurs with the Globe finding and believes that B/PB misrepresents its contractual role.
9068;;Based on B/PB's response it would appear that B/PB has been paid nearly $2 billion to simply monitor these design contracts, process payments, and pass documents through to the Turnpike Authority.
9069;;For $2 billion, the Commonwealth expected B/PB to do more than shuffle paper.

9071;;Olver cautioned that the State would still have to work very hard to come up with an acceptable plan to deal with the project's cost overruns.
9072;;Because of the reimbursable nature of the Federal-aid Highway program, the federal governments decision to withhold Big Dig reimbursements from the state until Massachusetts spends money on the state-wide program would significantly slow down the Central Artery project unless additional funding sources are found to keep the project on track.
9073;;The federal government has spent $5.7 billion to date on the Big Dig project, and has committed to a grand total of $8.5 billion based on a project completion date of 2004

9221;;Portable air horns, motor vehicle horns, propane cannons, starter pistols, low-powered pellet guns, slingshots, and rocks can be effective.
9222;;Be assertive in your attitude and behavior towards coyotes that are not showing normal, healthy fear and respect towards you and others.
9223;;If all efforts to dissuade problem coy otes fail, and they continue to be a nuisance or human safety concern, coyotes may have to be trapped and humanely euthanized.
9224;;Secure your garbage! Coyotes will raid open trash materials and compost piles.
9225;;Secure your garbage in tough plastic containers with tight fitting lids and keep in secure buildings when possible.
9226;;Take out trash the morning pick up is scheduled, not the previous night.
9227;;Keep compost piles in containers designed to contain but vent the material.
9228;;Don't feed or try to pet coyotes! Keep wild things wild! Feeding, whether direct or indirect, can cause coyotes to act tame and over time may lead to bold behavior.
9229;;Coyotes that rely on natural food items remain wild and wary of humans.
923;;Mears Yacht Haven in Oxford (Talbot County) - General Manager Tom Gannon: Mears Yacht Haven is working hard to ensure that fuel and waste oil are handled properly at the marina.
9230;;Keep your pets safe! Although free roaming pets are more likely to be killed by automobiles than by wild animals, coyotes do view cats and small dogs as potential food and larger dogs as competition.
9231;;For the safety of your pets, keep them restrained at all times.
9232;;Keep bird feeder areas clean! Use feeders designed to keep seed off the ground as the seed attracts many small mammals coyotes prey upon.
9233;;Remove feeders if coyotes are regularly seen around your yard.
9234;;Feed pets indoors! Outdoor feeding attracts many wild animals to your door!
9235;;Close off crawl spaces under porches and sheds! Coyotes use such areas for resting and raising young.
9236;;Don't let coyotes intimidate you! Don't hesitate to scare or threaten coyotes with loud noises, bright lights, or water.
9237;;Cut back brushy edges in your yard! These areas provide cover for coyotes and their prey.
9238;;Never feed a coyote - Deliberately feeding coyotes puts pets and other residents in the neighborhood at risk and it's against the law to feed coyotes or other wildlife.
9239;;Also, people can inadvertently feed coyotes by leaving pet food or garbage where they can get it.
924;;Along with signs that are posted around the property reminding customers about proper waste disposal, they also have a spill response kit at their fuel dock in case of emergencies.
9240;;Feed pets indoors or promptly remove outdoor dishes, bring bird feeders in at night, store bags of pet food indoors, and use trash cans with lids that clamp shut.
9241;;Clear brush and dense weeds from around dwellings - Reduce protective cover for coyotes and make the area less attractive to rodents.
9242;;Coyotes, as well as other predators, may be attracted to areas where rodents are concentrated, such as wood piles and seed storage areas.
9243;;Protect children - Although rare, coyotes have been known to attack and seriously injure young children.
9244;;Never leave small children unattended in areas known to be frequented by coyotes, even in familiar surroundings, such as a backyard.
9245;;Protect pets and livestock - Keep small pets such as cats, rabbits, and small dogs indoors, especially at night.

9251;;Use a loud, authoritative voice to frighten the animal
9252;;Do not allow dogs to run with coyotes.
9253;;Although it appears they are "playing " coyotes can turn on dogs to defend their territory.
9254;;Don't leave pet food outside.

9262;;A high fence around an airport will help keep out most coyotes.
9263;;Trapping, snaring and shooting are other options.
9264;;The best solution is to keep small pets inside or an eye on them when outside.
9265;;If that is not possible, lethal methods, such as shooting, trapping and snaring, are options in areas that permit their use.
9266;;If the den can be located, removing the pups will solve the problem.
9267;;Human disturbance at the den usually will cause coyotes to move the pups
9268;;While the fossil record can "indicate" presence of mammoths, rhinos, camels, horses, burros, ground sloths, etc., it usually provides little direct evidence as to which were "grazers" and which were social animals in "herds"

9296;;Also, when we find fossil animals that are ancestors of modern day animals we can look at the modern descendants of that family of animals and infer how the animals may have interacted.
9297;;This stenomylus from Agate Fossil Beds is an ancestor of camels.
9298;;A lack of permanent structures most likely points to a highly mobile group, a theory which is also supported by the faunal remains associated with Paleo-Indian sites.
9299;;Many such sites also contain remains of large mammals such as: mammoth, mastodon, bison, caribou, deer, camel, and horse.

9301;;Now-extinct elephants (mastodons and mammoths), wild horses, ground sloths, camels and giant bison roamed the forests and grasslands of our area
9302;;The plants and animals of North America look very different today compared to those of the Ice Age.
9303;;Many Ice Age animals, like mammoth, mastodon, musk oxen, bison, and ground sloths were larger than their modern relatives.
9304;;Beaver, for example, were as large as today's black bear.
9305;;Medium sized animals included horses, camels, elk, and deer.
9306;;Large predators such as sabre-toothed cats, lions, dire wolves, and short-faced bears were also present.
9307;;The trend toward a more arid climate continued during the Miocene and Pliocene Epochs.
9308;;The Rocky Mountains were nearly at their highest elevation and intercepting most of the moisture from the Pacific.
9309;;The Miocene plant community looked more like today's plant community.
931;;For example, if a fuel hose breaks within a boat and then an automatic bilge pump empties the fuel overboard, the marina has the equipment and knowledge to respond immediately.
9310;;In the Northern Great plains region, grazing and browsing mammals were found together in savanna-type habitat.
9311;;The titanotheres were extinct.
9312;;Horses, rhinoceros, and camels inhabited the savannas, meadows,and wooded streams.
9313;;Catfish, frogs, turtles, and beavers were present in the scattered ponds
9314;;As the composition and distribution of vegetation changed, the distribution of animals also changed.
9315;;Ranges of many species moved northward with the retreating ice sheet.
9316;;Animals that could not digest the new coarse vegetation of the grasslands, like the horse, mammoth, rhinoceros, and camel became extinct in North America.
9317;;Other species, like the bison, deer and elk, moved into the available habitat and survived
9318;;Called Beringia, this land bridge would disappear as water rose during warmer periods.
9319;;Geologists believe that Beringia was exposed for travel at different times, around 38,000 BC, 26,000 BC, and 11,000 BC.
932;;They also installed a bulletin board devoted to information about clean boating practices for customers.
9320;;These intervals would have allowed animals and humans to migrate from one continent to another, in either direction.
9321;;Animal fossils provide the proof of a migratory route between the two continents.
9322;;Ancient camels and horses originated on our continent and migrated to Asia, leaving only fossils in North America.
9323;;The Early Tertiary Period (called Paleogene in European references) consists of the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene epochs.
9324;;Land plants and animals became the primary forms of life and remain so today.
9325;;Mammals increased dramatically in both number and type with the widespread prairies supporting a variety of horses, camels and other larger animals.
9326;;Water supported an environment where pelicans, herons, swans, frogs and turtles lived.
9327;;Grasslands supported animals such as the horse, camel and antelope.
9328;;This fauna has come to be known by scientists as the Pleistocene mega fauna.
9329;;The fossil record indicates that grazing herds of elephants, mammoths, rhinos, camels, horses, burros, ground sloths, and many other grazers and browsers roamed throughout western North America for several million years

9374;;The environment became considerably warmer in the succeeding Archaic Period, the large game animals disappeared and were replaced by new plant and animal species.
9375;;The Paleoindian people of the Great Plains were highly mobile hunters of animals, many species of which are now extinct.
9376;;Ice Age species like the Wooly Mammoth, a very large type of bison called bison antiquus, species of camels, and modern species that survive until the present, such as pronghorn antelope, elk, deer and many others, were hunted by throwing spears or atl atls tipped with beautifully made stone projectile points.
9377;;At the end of the ice age, 20,000 years ago, Asiatic hunters and gatherers crossed the Bering Land Bridge into Alaska.
9378;;These early cultures pursued dwindling herds of Pleistocene mammoth, camel, horse, bison and other now-extinct species into most of North and South America.

938;;The owner also created a poster of clean boating tips and posted it prominently outside the bath house.
9380;;Many of the animals found at Hagerman originated in North America and later dispersed to other continents.
9381;;Certainly horses and camels come to mind as two classic examples of groups that were present only in North America during most of their history, but later crossed the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Europe.
9382;;If it hadn't been for this dispersal we might only know about horses and camels from their fossils, since their descendants survived in the Old World after both groups became extinct in their "homeland" at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch or Ice Age.
9383;;While horses and camels, along with other animals such as beavers, went west, other groups such as the proboscideans, (which includes living elephants and their extinct relatives like mammoths and mastodons) moved east and entered North America
9384;;The Mascail Formation dates from about 15 million years ago.
9385;;The ash deposits and erosional outwash materials that became the Mascall Formation were from the Strawberry Volcanoes that stood to the south at that time.
9386;;Lush grasslands and hardwood forests, similar to the eastern U.S., were home to a great variety of animals that we might recognize as horses, camels and deer as well as bears, weasels, dogs, and cats
9387;;With the onset of rapid deglaciation, mixed hardwood-pine forests began to move northward from the lower Southeast, and by 10,000 years ago spread across the entire region.

9391;;Great herds of small horses, rhinoceroses, camels, and other dwellers on the savanna came to water holes to drink and perhaps to wallow in the cool and refreshing pools.
9392;;Speaking of camels, here comes a herd of Stenomylus ("narrow tooth") bounding through the tall grass on the south bank of the river.
9393;;This is a strange little long-neck camel that strayed off the main line of the family's evolution.
9394;;Less than 60 centimeters (24 inches) high at the shoulder, it looks very much like the living African antelope called the gerenuk.

9402;;Horses and camels are both native to North America.
9403;;After their expansion into other parts of the world, camels and horses became extinct in North America at the end of the Ice Age.
9404;;Similarly, the remains of ancestral horses and camels in rocks of South Dakota show that the area was then dry land or that land was nearby.
9405;;Other recent discoveries of Ice Age animals in northern Utah include camels and horses from a site near the Kennecott Copper Mine, on the east flank of the Oquirrh Mountains; and horses, mastodon, and other smaller animals at the Little Dell Reservoir in East Canyon a few miles east of Salt Lake City.
9406;;The scientific name Camelus is derived from the Latin language and means camel.
9407;;Small, goat-sized camels lived in North Dakota about 30 million years ago.
9408;;This metatarsus (foot bone) is however from a camel that inhabited North Dakota during the last Ice Age.
9409;;It would have been about the size of a llama.
941;;They want to be prepared in case of a spill from any of their slip-holders.
9410;;These camels became extinct in North America several thousand years ago.
9411;;This fossil was found in a gravel deposit near Williston, Williams County
9412;;Mineral Hill Cave also records significant changes in faunal composition from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene.
9413;;During pre-Glacial Maximum times, the central Great Basin supported populations of camel, big-headed llama, at least two species of horse, Bison antiquus, mountain deer, mountain sheep, pronghorn, and, tentatively, American cheetah.
9414;;Mineral Hill Cave helps fill a gap in our knowledge of pre-Glacial Maximum faunal composition in the central Great Basin.
9415;;Poebrotherium wilsoni (Figure 1) from the Orellan of North America is the most well known early camelid, and a member of the central stock from which modern camels and llamas have evolved.
9416;;Skeletal remains indicate P. wilsoni was a lightly built artiodactyl measuring approximately 75 cm in height.
9417;;It was unique among its contemporaries in having a long slender neck and limbs that were well suited for efficient running.
9418;;The dental characteristics of Poebrotherium are primitive for the family Camelidae
9419;;Camelids (suborder Tylopoda) underwent nearly forty million years of evolution in North America (McKenna, 1966; Schultz, 1959; Scott, 1929, 1940; Wilson, 1974; Wortman, 1898).
942;;The managers of Mears Yacht Haven in Oxford maintain an oil spill response kit at their fuel dock and have signs conspicuously posted around the property to remind customers about proper waste disposal.
9420;;During the Plio-Pleistocene (3 MYBP), some species of the llama-like genus Hemiauchenia migrated to South America via the Panamanian Land Bridge and gave rise to Llama and Vicugna about 2 MYBP (Webb; 1965, 1972, 1974).
9421;;Contemporaneously, other species, possibly in the genus Paracamelus, migrated from North America to Eurasia via the Beringia Land Bridge ultimately giving rise to the two Old World camels, Camelus dromedarius and C.bactrianus (Gauthier-Pilthers and Dagg, 1981).
9422;;Camels became extinct in North America as recently as 10,000-12,000 years ago with Camelops surviving well into the Pleistocene
9423;;The camels with the very slender legs and long necks are called Oxydactylus ("sharp finger").
9424;;They are browsing on the willows where the herd of Nanotragulus ran to hide.
9425;;Oxydactylus is an important camel, standing about at the midpoint in the evolution of this North American family of mammals.
9426;;The camels will remain stay-at-homes in the continent of their origin until they spread into Eurasia and South America at the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch, some 21.5 million years after the rhinos died out at Agate.
9427;;There are many species of Oxydactylus; the one we are looking at stands about 1.2 meters (4 feet) high at the shoulder.
9428;;Notice that they don't have humps on their backs; in this lush land there is no need to store fat against a time of possible starvation
9429;;We also are pleased that the U.S. funding for the Cambodia Genocide Project at Yale University, directed by Professor Ben Kiernan, and of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, ably administered by Youk Chhang, has proven instrumental in recording the crimes of the Pol Pot regime

9510;;When it came to examining the causes of her own obesity, Gaquin pinned the blame in large part on her family background.
9511;;Both her parents, she said, were overweight, and two of her three siblings weigh more than she does
9512;;Genetics does play a part in deciding who is fat and who is thin, but the increasingly sedentary lifestyle led by most Americans is making it difficult for them to suppress the hunger gene, said Ellen Ruppel Shell, a journalist and author who has written about the role a person's DNA plays in deciding how much he or she eats
9513;;A number of studies have shown that genetics may be the most important determinant of how much you weigh.
9514;;The same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine also reported on a study comparing the body mass of 673 pairs of identical and fraternal Swedish twins who had been raised together or apart to determine how much influence heredity had over obesity (identical twins have the exact same genetic makeup whereas fraternal twins do not; twins who were raised together were subject to the same environmental influences while those who were raised apart were not).
9515;;Even if they had grown up together, the fraternal twins were less likely than the identical twins to share a similar pattern of body weight whereas identical twins--even when raised apart--did not vary significantly in weight.
9516;;The researchers concluded that genetic factors, apart from diet or lifestyle, strongly influence how much a person weighs.
9517;;Studies are showing that the genes are not destiny but are still a significant factor in developing obesity
9518;;An obesity gene which could pass from father to child has been discovered by scientists in Paris."</

952;;Once adopted by the jurisdictions, the EPA will work expeditiously to review the new or revised standards, which will then be used as the basis for removing the Bay and its tidal rivers from the list of impaired waters.
9520;;Heredity is also linked to obesity.
9521;;If both of your parents are obese, your changes of becoming obese are 80%; one parent, 40%; and with lean parents, 10%.
9522;;It is important to note that the link is not 100%.
9523;;Even if your entire family is overweight, obesity is not inevitable!
9524;;Although it was once thought that a lack of will power--eating too much--and a lack of physical activity caused obesity, it is now recognized that family influence, genetics (including your basal metabolic rate, or BMR), and cultural and psychological factors all contribute to becoming obese.
9525;;Heredity also plays a big role -- a child of obese parents has an 80% risk of being obese, while the child of parents who are not obese has only a 10% likelihood of being obese.

9527;;A study of 277 schoolchildren and their families showed a pattern of obesity that followed the classic model for recessive inheritance.
9528;;In one study, adults who were adopted as children were found to have weights closer to their biological parents than to their adoptive parents.

9530;;Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that obesity or at least the inclination toward it is due in part to heredity after a study of 101 girls and their parents
9531;;Human obesity is often a familial disorder; obese parents tend to produce obese offspring.
9532;;While this observation does not distinguish the influences of heredity and environment, studies of twins suggest that there is a substantial genetic component to human obesity
9533;;The tendency to gain weight often runs in families.
9534;;Studies of adopted twins raised apart show that they tend to have the body mass index (BMI) of their biological parents (not their adoptive parents).
9535;;It is estimated that 25% to 70% of the difference in weight between individuals is due to heredity.
9536;;Genes could also influence behaviors such as food choices, eating, and physical activity, although little attention has been given to this aspect of the role of heredity in obesity.
9537;;However, it is important to remember that heredity only determines the tendency to become obese, and that factors such as your culture, your activity level, and your diet determine whether you develop obesity.

9541;;Report prepared for the Bank of Canada in response to a July 1997 allegation based on an anonymous late-war intelligence report that the bank of Canada had been party, by means of paper transfer, to a complex gold transfer involving six tons of gold shuffled first between Switzerland and Portugal in 1942 and later between Portugal and Sweden with Canada's central bank playing the role of intermediary.
9542;;During WWII, Switzerland served as a curtain for other countries by creating multinational gold depository for neutral and non-aligned national states - Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Turkey - to use in trading money with the Axis
9543;;Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey all sold Nazi Germany resources critical to sustaining its wartime industry
9544;;Germany and Portugal negotiated secret agreements in accordance with which Portugal exported an average of over 2,000 metric tons of wolfram to Germany annually between 1941 and mid-1944, about 60 percent of Germany's estimated minimum industrial requirement, which the Allies estimated to be 3,500 tons annually.
9545;;Although Switzerland figured prominently in the May 1997 preliminary report on gold looted by the Nazis and the use of that gold in financing Germany's wartime trade, with only brief mention of other countries, the supplement, entitled U.S. and allied wartime and postwar relations and negotiations with Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey on looted gold and other assets stolen or hidden by Germany during World War II, provides a detailed analysis of the economic roles played by the other wartime neutrals
9546;;Portugal only provided some $4 million of the some $51 million the Allies initially sought with negotiations dragging on throughout the 1950s.
9547;;A small amount of gold was returned and assets liquidated.
9548;;Negotiations with Portugal were even more protracted, with gold discussions dragging on into the 1950s because of Portuguese resistance.

9552;;The Portuguese Government allowed Jewish organizations to relocate from occupied Europe to Lisbon during the War.
9553;;During 1941 and 1942 the Portuguese Government allowed 5,000 refugees to pass through Portugal to the United States.
9554;;In this trade, more than $300 million ($2.6 billion in today's values) in Nazi gold reached Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey during the War.
9555;;The Allies began this economic war with some advantages, most notably a centuries-old Anglo-Portuguese alliance, coupled with close economic and trade relations (Britain was Portugal's leading trade partner), as well as Portugal's dependence on U.S. petroleum, coal, and chemical supplies.
9556;;Germany, Portugal's second largest trade partner, also enjoyed significant advantages, particularly after its occupation of France gave it a direct overland route to the Iberian Peninsula, through which it could both supply Portugal with greater quantities of imports than the Allies and pose a military threat if Portugal attempted to curtail exports important to the German war effort.
9557;;Portugal allowed Britain to trade and receive credit backed by the pound, allowing Britain to obtain vital goods at a time when it was short on gold and escudos.
9558;;Portugal and Spain together provided Germany with almost 100 percent of Germany's wartime supply of vitally-needed wolfram, the essential mineral in processing tungsten for steel alloys used in machine tools and armaments, especially armor-piercing shells.
9559;;The Allies estimated that Germany financed its imports from Spain and Portugal with as much as $204 million in looted gold

9633;;SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML. SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text.
9634;;The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects, template objects and extensibility.
9635;;SVG drawings can be dynamic and interactive.
9636;;A rich set of event handlers such as onmouseover and onclick can be assigned to any SVG graphical object.
9637;;Because of its compatibility and leveraging of other Web standards, features like scripting can be done on SVG elements and other XML elements from different namespaces simultaneously within the same Web page.
9638;;Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is XML-based, highly compact, and interactive.
9639;;A vector graphic can be resized to fit a particular display screen (e.g. cell phone screen, PDA).
964;;This new policy will bring the most up-to-date environmental land management techniques, such as BayScapes, green building, and low-impact development to all state property.
9640;;The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) map is an exciting new technology and makes panning and zooming possible without running a web server.
9641;;SVG stands for "Scalable Vector Graphic."
9642;;SVG is an XML-based graphics language from W3C specifications.
9643;;SVGs are vector images that scale well in a variety of displays, from desktop monitors to PDAs to wireless phones.
9644;;SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - this is the new XML based graphics protocol.
9645;;It's primary use is for web applications.
9646;;So, because it's text-based and XML-based, the SVG can be generated on the fly, from a database or an application.
9647;;Because it's text within SVG, as opposed to XML tags, it's not bitmapped.
9648;;It's searchable, indexable, selectable, copyable, and accessible (which gets at Section 508 considerations [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act,
9649;;An SVG file is a small file, so it downloads faster.
965;;Increased funding for Cover Crops -- this agricultural best management practice, where farmers plant fall grain crops in just-harvested fields, keeps nutrients from entering waterways during winter months.
9650;;It's a description of how to draw something, as opposed to the actual bits.
9651;;It's device-independent.
9652;;It targets more devices; has better printing capabilities; can pan; can zoom in on details that aren't initially visible; you don't get the pixilation that you get on JPEG; it has a grouping capability; layering; hierarchy; and dynamic generation.
9653;;SVG allows you to tie into other XML applications.
9654;;You can also try to use it as a user interface.
9655;;One way is using SVG as an interface.
9656;;The atlas drawings are converted into SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), the emerging XML format for vector graphics.
9657;;SVG files are accessed via a Web interfacethat (1) establishes the common Paxinos 3D coordinate space "on the fly" byexamining slice metadata and interrelationships between shapes on each slice, and (2) allows the user to associate labels with graphic representations of anatomical structures, as well as encode topological relationships between anatomical structres (such as "inside", "adjacent", "contains", "intersects" etc.) by filling in a form.

9659;;SVG allows to see dynamically changed images without visible blinking.
966;;Introducing the idea of a level playing field, for agriculture in Maryland, through implementation of national standards for nonpoint source discharges, so manufacturers or producers cant simply move to a another location where they can continue to pollute.
9660;;In addition to working with OASIS to improve graphics standards, the W3C is developing a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) language that defines an XML tag set for vector graphics.
9661;;Scalable Vector Graphics o XML language to represent graphics o SVG drawings can be dynamic and interactive o A valuable instrument where graphics need to be manipulated dynamically o Limited functionality for for capturing and processing text oriented data o SVG is primarily an XML based presentation technique o SVG is an adjunct to PDF not a replacement
9662;;SVG Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML based graphics format.
9663;;SVG is intended primarily for web development.
9664;;However, Adobe now provides a free stand alone viewer for SVG format files
9665;;For more than 270 years, the banks and the channel of the Mississippi River have been engineered for various purposes: originally, starting about 1720, for flood control

9668;;The magnitude of the damages-in terms of property, disrupted business, and personal traumawas unmatched by any other flood disaster in United States history .
9669;;During spring and summer 1993, the hydrologic effects of extended rainfall throughout the upper midwestern United States were severe and widespread.
967;;Pointing out that the success of the Clean Water Act of 1972 was significantly due to funding that fixed point sources of pollution.
9670;;Record flooding inundated much of the upper Mississippi Basin.
9671;;From spring through summer of 1993, severe flooding in the upper Mississippi River Basin resulted from intense, persistent, widespread rainfall from January through September.
9672;;The analysis used flow data from 1993, 1986, and 1973 floods and developed water surface profiles resulting from the same flood flows without levees.
9673;;ord flooding also occurred in 1973 along the Mississippi River, where backwater inundated 474,000 acres at a loss of $40 million.
9674;;The Mississippi River flooded at Red River Landing from May 23 until June 8.
9675;;The National Weather Service ranks this flood as one of the greatest ever to have hit the United States.
9676;;The flooding started in late May 1993--10 years ago--and lasted until September of that year.
9677;;In some places the floodwaters didn't subside until October.
9678;;More than a thousand levees in the Midwest failed or were overtopped as flooding exceeded the presumed "worst-case" design specifications.
9679;;On August 1, 1993, the largest peak discharge since 1844 was measured in St. Louis on the Mississippi River by the U.S. Geological Survey.
968;;The Governor suggested similar federal funding to control nonpoint sources of nitrogen and phosphorus is needed nationally.
9680;;The flood of 1993 was slightly greater than a 100-year flood event.
9681;;A 100-year flood event will be exceeded on the average once in 100 years.
9682;;There is a 1 percent chance that such a flood will occur in any year
9683;;Floods are natural repetitive phenomena.
9684;;Considering the nation's short history of hydrologic recordkeeping as well as the limited knowledge of long-term weather patterns, flood recurrence intervals are difficult to predict.
9685;;Although upland watershed treatment and restoration of upland and bottomland wetlands can reduce flood stages in more frequent floods (25 years and less) it is questionable whether they would have significantly altered the 1993 conditions.
9686;;Many people think of flooding only in relation to a flood of a 100-year magnitude.
9687;;They overlook the fact that although government regulators have selected the 100-year flood as a reasonable regulatory standard, it is not the only magnitude of flood that can occur.
9688;;Floods are random, variable events.
9689;;Through frequency analysis, hydrologists can characterize them as a 50-year flood, 100-year flood, or 500-year flood.
969;;Finally, a Challenge Grant Fund for habitat restoration on school property, so the lessons taught about the Bay and the environment can be experienced first hand.
9690;;The Midwest flood of 1993 varied from less than a 50-year flood at St. Paul, Minnesota, to less than a 100-year flood at Lincoln, Nebraska,1 to over a 100-year flood at St. Louis, Missouri
9691;;Prior to the Great Floods of 1993, Missouri received federal disaster declarations due to flooding in the spring of 1990, October 1986, June 1984, December 1982, August 1982 (Jackson County), April 1979, September 1977, July 1976, June 1974, and for extensive flooding in April 1973 and again in November 1973.
9692;;Missouri's vulnerability to flooding is greatly increased because it is subject to flooding from two principal sources: the Missouri River Basin and the upper Mississippi River Basin.
9693;;More than a year has passed since the brutal Red River flood devastated Grand Forks, North Dakota, and many communities and farms in the Red River Valley.
9694;;And it has been five years since the great Mississippi River and Minnesota River floods turned many towns into temporary lakes.
9695;;The 1993 flood broke record river levels set during the 1973 Mississippi and the 1951 Missouri River floods
9696;;however, the flood of 1993 will be remembered not only for its intensity and duration, but as the largest flood in 150 years in the area.
9697;;During the late 19th and early part of the 20th centuries, widespread heavy rain created numerous devastating floods on the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi basins.
9698;;Such floods as those of 1912 and 1922 lead up to the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927 with increasing severity in each succeeding event
9699;;Consistently high flows during the growing season resulted in abnormally high soil moisture, which eliminated many tree species in favor of moisture-tolerant ones such as willow and silver maple.
97;;A flow through system will be installed to recreate similar living conditions that are found in the mussels' natural habitat.
970;;New water quality goals for the Bay cleanup established with the aid of the Bay Programss updated Water Quality model.
9700;;The soils commonly need to be drained of water before they can be productive but once drained the land supports high yields of almost any crop.
9701;;The soils maintain their fertility because the Mississippi River and its tributaries have often flooded, depositing new sediment and replenishing the topsoil.
9702;;Occasional hurricanes (approximately one every 7 to 15 years) ravage and flood areas of the coastal Delta and may produce damaging effects a few hundred miles inland.
9703;;These hurricane events cause crop and property damage from flooding, erosion, and high winds; however, the hurricanes are relatively few and the Delta bounces back quickly
9704;;Records indicate that great floods of the Mississippi have occurred frequently.
9705;;Nine great floods were recorded between 1782 and 1850.
9706;;In 1882, one of the most disastrous floods to that time devastated the entire Delta area of 45,000 square miles.
9707;;The losses were appalling.
9708;;Hundreds of crevasses occurred in the weak levees.
9709;;The breaks in the levees sent floodwaters into populated areas and left thousands homeless.
971;;Implementati on, and expansion, of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a federal/state cost sharing partnership that will mean many of new buffer and scores of acres of wetlands on agricultural fields and along streams.
9710;;Additional major floods followed in 1912 and 1913.
9711;;In 1927 the most devastating of modem floods occurred, inundating an area of about 26,000 square miles, or more than 16 million acres.
9712;;After the great flood of 1927, other floods on the Mississippi occurred in 1929, 1937, 1945, 1950, 1973, 1975, 1979, 1983, and in 1993.
9713;;The interval between major floods on the Mississippi average one every seven years.
9714;;Large-scale storms that produce floods on the lower Mississippi River occur chiefly during January through April and to a lesser extent in May and June.
9715;;The recur rence interval of the flood ranged from less than 100 years at many locations to near 500 years on segments of the Mississippi River from Keithsburg, Illinois, to above St. Louis, Missouri, and on segments of the Missouri River from Rulo, Nebraska, to above Hermann, Missouri.
9716;;Aadland, Sparks, and other researchers add perspective by taking a step back from the immediate human toll to look at floods over the long haul.
9717;;Sparks notes that flooding occurs on three time scales: Annual spring floods are the most frequent, happening almost every year.
9718;;Next are infrequent, large floods such as the Mississippi River flood of 1993 and last year's Red River flood.
9719;;And then there are whoppers that humans have scarcely seen, but which scientists know happen regularly over thousands of years.

9722;;Prior to human alteration, determining where river channels ended and flood plains began was neither easy nor particularly important.
9723;;In the spring, the Mississippi normally overflowed and temporarily inundated low areas in the flood plain.
973;;This new policy will bring the most up-to-date environmental land management techniques, such as BayScapes, green building, and low-impact development to all state property.
974;;Most of what their Dockmaster, Robert Muir, did to earn the award was sharing emergency information and clean boating practices with the slip holders.
975;;He used not only printed material but the neighborhood's secure web site to make the information readily available and easy to update.
976;;The community has fully embraced the notion and are proud to be among the Clean Marinas in Maryland.
977;;To become certified, owner Frank Lampron and manager Russ Kirkhoff reviewed their required plans and permits, ensured they were all current, and improved their spill response kit and fueling procedures.
978;;They also improved written emergency response plans and stormwater management plans.
979;;Their attention to detail with the many plans and permits required for marinas that store fuel and haul boats, was especially important to their success.
98;;A new industry is anticipated to evolve from this research program.
980;;Taylor 's Marina simply offers slips, with water and electricity, and access to all the repair services at Locust Point.
981;;There is also a pool and a small-engine repair shop on site.
982;;The Guttendorf 's smartly carried over all their emergency plans and "environmental rules" for customers and contractors to Taylor 's customers.
983;;To earn the award members Ron Riland and Earl Waesche, with club support, created a set of environmental rules and practices for both members and contractors, and promoted the recycling of used oil, antifreeze, batteries and other waste by posting directions to the nearest collection facility in a prominent location.
984;;Manager Alex Schlegel made some improvements to his stormwater management controls, and repaired damage previously done by stormwater, as part of his certification.
985;;He and his staff also included Clean Boating Tip Sheets (from the Clean Marina Guidebook) in mailings to all customers, to enlist their help in keeping the yard clean.
986;;They routinely use filter cloth and dustless sanders on all boats having major work done.
987;;They also recycle used oil, batteries, and aluminum cans.
988;;Operators of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs qualify for Clean Marina certification by adopting measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff, and facilities management.
989;;To date, 122 boating facilities have taken the first step and signed the Clean Marina Pledge.
99;;The new industry would have great commercial and economic impacts on rural areas of the Southeastern United States.
990;;Of these, 34 have been certified as Clean Marinas and 5 have been certified as Clean Marina Partners
991;;Mark Julyan, General Manager of Knapps Narrows Marina, maintains a clean marina by insisting on vacuum sanding in the yard and using ground tarps when heavy work is being conducted.
992;;Mark also enforces strict rules on the fuel dock and gives each customer a small oil-sorb cloth to capture any drips or spills.
993;;Additionally, he has strengthened his contracts with all slip holders, land storage customers, and subcontractors to include the statement that the marina follows Clean Marina practices and expects all customers to do the same.
994;;Knapps Narrows Marina also took advantage of Clean Marina grant funding in 2001 to purchase a wash water recycling system, vacuum sanders, a high-volume lowpressure spray gun, and to install a vegetated riparian buffer to filter stormwater.
995;;As reported in the last issue Ken and Barbara Broman, owners of Oak Harbor Marina, and their sons have made many of Under way, Sunset Marina (Ocean City) was certified this improvements to Oak Harbor Marina to earn their Award.
996;;They purchased the marina and boatyard spring.
997;;The Bromans cut up and removed many abandoned boats, had old containers and drums professionally removed, and have put new yard rules into place to keep things moving in the right direction.
998;;They have filled up several roll-off dumpsters with trash and debris from the yard, cleaning up from years of bad habits of previous land storage customers.
999;;The Bromans have also improved employee training and emergency preparedness to become a Clean Marina.
