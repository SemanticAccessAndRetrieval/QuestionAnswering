If you stay beyond 12pm you get charged a further Â¥400 per hour. We found out the hard way with a Â¥2000 charge. Also we didn't realise there would be a further Â¥1200 charge for hire of the cot. This wasn't charged on arrival when you pay for the room, so was also a surprise when we checked out. - The location of the property was great. It is based in Meriken park, right next to the earthquake memorial and easy access off the expressway. The hotel has its own parking which is really helpful (although is Â¥1600 for 24 hours). The staff are friendly as you would expect and the reception area of the hotel is stunning. We were there in December and they had a beautiful Christmas tree and accessories. As you go up the lift to your room there are great views of the reception area. We stayed with a toddler and requested a cot.

Their website states Â¥1600 per 24 hours. However we found that this was actually the price from when you check in until 12pm the next day. If you stay beyond 12pm you get charged a further Â¥400 per hour. We found out the hard way with a Â¥2000 charge. Also we didn't realise there would be a further Â¥1200 charge for hire of the cot. This wasn't charged on arrival when you pay for the room, so was also a surprise when we checked out. - The location of the property was great. It is based in Meriken park, right next to the earthquake memorial and easy access off the expressway. The hotel has its own parking which is really helpful (although is Â¥1600 for 24 hours). The staff are friendly as you would expect and the reception area of the hotel is stunning. We were there in December and they had a beautiful Christmas tree and accessories. As you go up the lift to your room there are great views of the reception area. We stayed with a toddler and requested a cot. As they weren't sure if the cot would be big enough (we have a two year old) they also kindly fitted a bed guard to one side of the double bed so we could use that if the cot was too small.;;11/12/2016;;0

This hotel is a typical onsen ryokan that provides only public onsen. There is no bathroom in the room, which means you have to take shower in the public shower next to the indoor onsen pool. Which also means you have to be naked in front of the public. This was the first time for me and my friend. I think it was acceptable (to be naked in front of other ladies), but not everyone can deal with this (include my friend). If you can't accept it, you might need to get some other ryokan that provides private onsen in the room. If you can accept it, please go and have a try, it will be a special experience for you. - The hotel staffs were very good. Though they don't speak English (couldn't really communicate in simple English at all) they tried to explain until we understand. They are friendly and put smile on their face and greet us every time when we saw them in the hotel compound. The onsen were excellent!
